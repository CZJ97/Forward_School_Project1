While the data shows that vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases, it also underscores the risk that even those inoculated could be contagious, so that inoculation alone may not suffice to halt transmission."

'Where we are right now is a very different place from where we were a year ago,' Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA, told MSNBC.

Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the remaining cases which make up 96.8 per cent are cases under the CAT-1 and CAT-2, or low-risk categories.  “There are 260 CAT-5 patients who are critical and in need of ventilators, 129 CAT-4 patients who need oxygen, 127 CAT-3 patients who have lung infection, 6,901 CAT-2 patients with mild symptoms while 8,485 patients have no symptoms,” he said in a statement today.  Malaysia registered a second consecutive day of record-high Covid-19 numbers today, surpassing yesterday’s unprecedented 15,573 cases.  Dr Noor Hisham had earlier said that the number of new Covid-19 infections detected over the last 24 hours was 15,902, giving Malaysia a cumulative total of 996,393 since the pandemic began."

As such, he said the vaccination rollout played a pivotal role in ensuring the Delta variant did not undermine recovery efforts.  “Our vaccine rollout now is among the best in Asia, if not in the world. More than 15% of the population have received two doses and it is important to fully vaccinate more than 50%.  “However, we may see its effect only later. Perhaps not in terms of the number of positive cases, but the number of hospital admissions and deaths,” he said."

TOPGLOV,NatsukoMishima,430 posts,2021-07-23 14:07:00,【新冠肺炎】抗疫到“关键时刻”　美又现“超级真菌”致3死  （华盛顿23日讯）美国疾病预防和控制中心(CDC)主任瓦伦斯基，当地时间周四再次对美国当前疫情发出紧急呼吁，警告称美国尚未完全脱离疫情。另一方面，美国出现“超级真菌”传播事件，已造成3人死亡。  中新网报导，瓦伦斯基表示，印度变种病毒Delta是科学家见过的最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。  她强调，Delta比之前的（新冠肺炎）毒株更具侵略性和传染性。 “这是我们目前所知的、也是我从业20年以来所见的，最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。”   Delta目前正在全美迅速传播，截至本周，在已测序的病例中，感染该变种病毒的病例已经占到总数的83%；而在7月初，这个数字还只有50%。  瓦伦斯基还对全美疫情发出警告，称Delta正在低疫苗接种率地区广泛传播，这是美国又一个抗疫的“关键时刻”。  瓦伦斯基恳请尚未接种疫苗的人“严肃对待Delta ”。她强调，“这种病毒不会自动放弃，它会不断搜寻脆弱的人并感染他们。请考虑接种疫苗，并在此前注意防疫”。  《纽约时报》指出，这与白宫数周前的态度形成鲜明对比。独立日期间，美国总统拜登在白宫南草坪举行盛大派对，宣布美国“从疫情中独立了”。  报导称，瓦伦斯基最新的表态显示，官方越来越担心已经取得的成就正在丧失，当前激增的病例可能让那些疫苗普及率低、住院率高的地方卫生系统不堪重负。  3类主要药物无效  另一方面，美国卫生官员周四表示，现在有证据表明，一种“无法治愈”的真菌在两家医院和一家疗养院内传播，已造成3人死亡。  根据美国疾控中心的报告，华盛顿特区的一家疗养院和得州达拉斯地区的两家医院爆发“超级真菌”感染。少数患者患有侵袭性真菌感染，3类主要药物对这些感染都是无效的。  美国疾控中心的博士莱曼称，“这确实是我们第一次开始看到耐药性聚集病例”，其中患者显然是在相互感染。  多年来，卫生官员在发现一些常用药物对真菌感染情况几乎无效后，就一直对这种超级真菌的可能出现发出警告。  2019年，医生在纽约诊断出3起病例，这些病例也对一类称作为棘白菌素的药物具有抗药性，该药物被认为是对抗真菌感染的最后一道防线；但在纽约的病例中，没有证据表明感染已在患者之间传播。科学家得出结论是，治疗过程中形成了对药物的耐药性。  不过，美国疾控中心对于最新出现的病例得出结论，这些真菌感染确实进行了传播。  在华盛顿特区，一家专门收治重病患者的疗养院中出现101例感染耳念珠菌病例，其中3例对所有3种抗真菌药物均具有抗药性。达拉斯地区两家医院的感染集群有22人，其中两例具有这种抗药性。  根据美国疾控中心的说法，这些病例发生在2021年1月至4月。在治疗完全无效的5人中，有3人死亡，其中两人是得州的医院病患，另一人在华盛顿。  莱曼表示，两地的病例都在持续爆发，自4月以来还发现了其他感染。但新增病例尚未被报告。  调查人员查看了医疗记录，没有发现这些集群中的患者以前使用过抗真菌药的证据。卫生官员表示，这意味著它们会在人与人之间传播。

TOPGLOV,Investoz88,128 posts,2021-07-23 16:00:00,"The US is at another pivotal moment in this pandemic as rising Covid-19 cases show no signs of abating, driven by the Delta variant, and some hospitals are filling up, especially in areas with low vaccination rates, government officials warned on Thursday.  The US government did not change its guidance on mask wearing, despite debates going on in the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about whether those who have been vaccinated should once again be officially advised to wear masks indoors to prevent the spread.  Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said that the Delta variant of coronavirus “is now spreading with incredible efficiency” in the US and that, compared with the original coronavirus strain that broke out in the US in early 2020, this variant is “more aggressive”. Advertisement  “It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that I have seen in my 20-year career,” she said at a White House briefing on Thursday, noting that the US is not out of the woods."

The world's worst coronavirus outbreak may have claimed as many as 5 million lives in India. India’s actual death toll from Covid-19 could range between 1.3 million to a staggering 5 million, with even the most conservative estimate putting its tally at more than double the U.S., the highest recorded in the world so far. While under-reporting of Covid fatalities is a global phenomenon, the problem is aggravated in India because deaths were already poorly counted before the pandemic. India's Covid death is 10X under reported. Nobody expected Delta variant to be so deadly. And yet globally its only warming up and have yet to unleash its full force yet.  Mayo Clinics: Delta variants infections will surge for months to come in the US. Delta is going to hit the low vaccinated states in US hard. Will be explosive as mentioned before due to cover ups and under reporting.   But once the shit hits the fan, then it will be explosive like India, Indonesia and South Africa and soon Malaysia, with overburdened healthcare services and people dying at the hospital corridors and car park. Malaysia has yet hit the peak.."

We can only follow so much sop. But if the variant is so infections that any surface u come into contact with that has covid on it will most certainly cause u to get infected also.   If this trend continues, I believe we will see a day where everyone go out need to wear gloves also when touching surfaces. If the vaccines become less effective and the variants continue.

TOPGLOV,anthonywml82,210 posts,2021-07-21 17:15:00,"DON'T ARGUE WITH DONKEYS (Fable)  The donkey said to the tiger: - ""The grass is blue"".  The tiger replied: - ""No, the grass is green.""  The discussion heated up, and the two decided to submit him to arbitration, and for this they went before the lion, the King of the Jungle.  Already before reaching the forest clearing, where the lion was sitting on his throne, the donkey began to shout: - ""His Highness, is it true that the grass is blue?"".  The lion replied: - ""True, the grass is blue.""  The donkey hurried and continued: - ""The tiger disagrees with me and contradicts and annoys me, please punish him.""  The king then declared: - ""The tiger will be punished with 5 years of silence.""  The donkey jumped cheerfully and went on his way, content and repeating: - ""The Grass Is Blue""...  The tiger accepted his punishment, but before he asked the lion: - ""Your Majesty, why have you punished me?, after all, the grass is green.""  The lion replied: - ""In fact, the grass is green.""  The tiger asked: - ""So why are you punishing me?"".  The lion replied: - ""That has nothing to do with the question of whether the grass is blue or green. The punishment is because it is not possible for a brave and intelligent creature like you to waste time arguing with a donkey, and on top of that come and bother me with that question.""  The worst waste of time is arguing with the fool and fanatic who does not care about truth or reality, but only the victory of his beliefs and illusions. Never waste time on arguments that don't make sense... There are people who, no matter how much evidence and evidence we present to them, are not in the capacity to understand, and others are blinded by ego, hatred and resentment, and all they want is to be right even if they are not.  When ignorance screams, intelligence is silent. Your peace and quiet are worth more."

Another nightmare in the red dot city. Do not be complacent when the number is low and dont let it spread like what happen like in Msia. More are suffering than b4. More death cases everyday until have to carry out mass burial everyday using excavator to dig the holes. Normally pun using cangkul only. It is unbearable and painful to see the such video in social media. So be more considerate do your part to keep yourself safe and when you are safe others also will be safe too. Follow lah SOP strictly. Correct?

Menurut Majlis Laporan Kewangan UK (Financial Reporting Council, FRC) dalam satu kenyataan berkata, agensi itu gagal mencapai tahap memuaskan untuk tahun ketiga berturu-turut.  “Hasil pemeriksaan menyeluruh terhadap KPMG mendapati syarikat tersebut masih gagal memperbaiki beberapa perkara yang telah kami kemukakan sebelum ini,  “Perkara ini telah berterusan selama 3 tahun berturut-turut, satu situasi yang sukar untuk diterima oleh kami,” kata FRC dalam laporan tahunan mereka yang dipetik oleh FInancial Times.  Menurutnya, KPMG perlu memperbaiki prosedur dan garis panduan untuk pasukan audit perbankan mereka bagi menghasilkan laporan yang lebih bermutu.  “Kami akan memantau perkembangan KPMG secara rapat,” kata FRC lagi.  Financial Times turut menyatakan KPMG sedang berhadapan dengan tindakan undang-undang berhubung laporan auditnya terhadap firma pembinaan UK, Carillion.  Difahamkan, KPMG disaman sebanyak 250 juta Pound dan difailkan di Mahkamah Tinggi England.  Selain daripada itu, firma audit terbabit turut didenda sebanyak 4 juta Pound pada tahun 2019 berikutan isu laporan dapatan mereka dalam Co-op Bank.  Pada tahun yan sama, KPMG turut didenda sebanyak 3.5 juta Pound berhubung laporan audit mereka terhadap syarikat pelaburan korporat, BNY Mellon. – airtimes.my"

We are dealing with an industry that are feeding 8 billion people across the planet.  FGV for instance already stated it's lock in forward sale of CPO till end 2021 is RM 4000 a ton. At their cost of production from RM1600 to RM1800, their profit margin is more than 100% for the next 6 months  Chappati and Tossei will never be the same without Mabel Oil (Palm Oil). Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Amir Khan send their regards to all Malaysian Farmers.  ECRL will cut through FGV and TDM at a Speed of 170km/h. Soon all these Plantation will increase in value...  Currently FGV is also only less than 10% of Mabel's Wilmar, Singapore. TDM is FOC..  So we just hold lor...  The key here is to park at any position as a multi-year investment. If you are struggling it mean you have insufficient liquidity or your position is too large. No big deal at all for Mabel to hold this Full Of Golden Values Stocks..  Understand Mouse?  TDM was mentioned very often because their Plantation comes equipped with Medical Centres across Malaysia. Furthermore Health Care was the flavour of the day due to C19. Here's the best part, they have the best doctor that can treat people like ConMouse who like to tell lies.  TDM compliments Mabel's HealthCare Collection.  Please don't forget to see Dr Ooi tomorrow Ya..  You really need help..  Dr Mabel Meow"
SERBADK,Mabel,13281 posts,2021-07-24 14:27:00,"Haha Auntie Mouse lupa ka?  Let Mabel refresh your 80 year old mind...  On Plantations..  Mabel has calculated  If I take out money in bank FD for 1 year at 1.75 sen interest a year I get?  I get 100/1.75 = 57.14 PE  So I will only double my money in  57.14 years at 1.75% Dividend rate per year  That is a very bad investment for me  As inflation at 10% to 20% will destroy my monetary value in no time  So Mabel put money in Oil Plantation is far safer proposition. Average PE for a Plantation Company is 30. Not only that, I'm also feeding 8 billion people across the planet. That's what I call a real services...  Mabel Farmeow"

SERBADK,Mikecyc,25020 posts,2021-07-24 17:59:00,"Haha something on Oil Price also ...    The Real Reason Oil Prices Aren’t At $80 By Simon Watkins - Jul 21, 2021, 8:00 PM   Partial from article :   As was very clearly demonstrated under the government of former President Donald Trump – but pertains to all U.S. presidencies of recent years – the top person in the White House does not, in general, want oil prices on the higher side. The economic reason for this is that for every US$0.01 that the U.S.’s national average price of gasoline rises, more than US$1 billion per year in discretionary additional consumer spending is estimated to be lost.   As a general historical rule of thumb, it is estimated that every US$10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil results in a US$0.25 change in the price of a gallon of gasoline. Based on more recent historical precedent, a US$90-95 per barrel of Brent oil price equates to around US$3 per gallon of gasoline and a US$125-130 per barrel of Brent equates to around US$4 per gallon of gasoline.   The ‘danger zone’ for U.S. presidents starts at around US$3.00 per gallon and at US$4.00 per gallon they are being advised to pack their bags in Pennsylvania Avenue or start a war to divert the public’s attention. The point was underlined by Bob McNally, the former energy adviser to the former President George W. Bush that: “Few things terrify an American president more than a spike in fuel [gasoline] prices.”"

""LONDON (Reuters) – KPMG’s bank audits have had to improve for an “unacceptable” third year in a row and the accounting firm is being closely monitored, the UK accountant said on Friday in an unusually blunt assessment by senior accountants.  The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the reviews of 103 audits by KPMG, PwC, Deloitte, EY, Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO in 2019 and 2020 showed almost a third of the improvements needed, just a marginally better result than in its previous annual survey.  The results put pressure on the government to propose laws to change corporate governance and the audit market, as recommended in three government-sponsored reviews following the collapse of UK retailer BHS and construction company Carillion.  “The inspection results at KPMG have not improved and it is unacceptable that the FRC found for the third consecutive year that KPMG̵  7;s audits of banks and similar companies need to be improved,” said a statement from the FRC.""

Is it really not following sop the primary reason ? I doubt it. Malaysians have been under lock down before nothing has changed but cases going up. What's not constant is the new variants. I believe the variants are what's causing covid to be much more infectious. Nothing to do with fully blaming Malaysians not following sop. We can only follow so much sop. But if the variant is so infections that any surface u come into contact with that has covid on it will most certainly cause u to get infected also.  If this trend continues, I believe we will see a day where everyone go out need to wear gloves also when touching surfaces. If the vaccines become less effective and the variants continue. This thing is going to go exponential. The initial variant of covid is not the same as the current delta and other variants.  Dr Mabel Meow"

If you are a net buyer of shares, why would you want the price to go up until you have bought everything you can?  JovaneChua 0.43 is the final good deal. 23/07/2021 4:46 PM  But nearly closed at 0.425  JovaneChua for those who are still queing to sell at 0.43, i can just pray hard for u, pray for wisdom for u. 23/07/2021 4:49 PM  Very few people had the urge to buy towards the end, some dogfish selling a few lots at 0.43 to make it look as though there was interest.  JovaneChua next week, let's go to 0.80 together. Now, lets do this 23/07/2021 4:50 PM  So you want to pay more for the same shares?  Overall, the people seem to judge the share at 0.425 - 0.43 even with the Fanboys best efforts.  The lying dogfish cannot get it up.

(July 23): KPMG LLP faced renewed criticism for the quality of its banking audits after the U.K.’s industry regulator said it was “unacceptable” that for the third year running the accounting firm’s work wasn’t up to scratch.  Across the U.K.’s seven biggest auditing firms -- including Ernst & Young and Deloitte -- almost 30% of all bookkeeping was below par in the year to the end of March, according to the Financial Reporting Council’s annual report. That’s well above the 10% benchmark the watchdog previously set.  Accountancy firms have faced intense scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors for any role they may have played in a string of company collapses and scandals. The FRC has opened investigations into the audits of Greensill Capital, a fintech that imploded earlier this year, and a bank owned by one of its largest borrowers.  “Given the systemic importance of banks to the U.K. economy,” the FRC said it “will be closely monitoring KPMG’s actions to ensure findings are addressed in a timely manner,” the FRC said Friday.  The firm has agreed to a set of additional improvement activities to be made this year, it said.  KPMG is “already working hard to make the necessary changes the FRC has highlighted,” the firm said in a statement. “Action taken as a result of previous inspections has not yet consistently yielded the high standards rightly expected of us.”  “Whilst we know we have more to do to improve the inspection outcomes, our banking audits are robust and the findings do not call into question our audit opinions,” KPMG said.  Deloitte, EY, Grant Thornton and PwC improved year-on-year, according to the FRC with around 80% or more of audits requiring no more than limited improvements. However, “these improved results still fall short of our expectations.”  “If the U.K. is to retain its position as a world leading professional services marketplace, and a global financial center, outstanding audit quality and rigorous professionalism is at the heart of this,” Jon Thompson, the FRC’s Chief Executive Officer, said in the statement."

Posted by PSAi3alert > Jul 23, 2021 2:03 PM | Report Abuse   --- Discussion holiday from Serba ---  Sslee, I will guess motherhood apple pie answers will be given.  Selling off the loss-making subsidiary for RM1 has provided the optics for an improved balance sheet and gives time for the company to smooth out the write-offs against earnings from the other profitable venture.  What is not visible, however, is the value of the previous subsidiary's tax losses. Four times ( 1/25%) of the accumulated losses can be used for channeling in pre-tax profits.  If transactions were to be undertaken to reap the benefits of the accumulated losses, and in parallel to the write-offs by the previous majority shareholder, secret profits would have been made. The party that has enjoyed the secret profits will become constructive trustee ( see also FHR Ventures v Cedar Capital ), and there is no statute of limitation for trust property.  The proper route that the Management should take is to get a judgment debtor sum and apply a garnishee order to attach the ex-subsidiary's bank accounts. In order to assess whether the Management will choose this route, I will do searches on the ex-subsidiary and the ex-subsidiary's now main shareholder's accounts and will zoom in on the names of officers and date of tabling of the last financial results.   Sslee Guess what Bursa reply me on below questions?  5. Impairment of trade receivables and other receivable bases on customers/related parties that are in financial difficulties and have defaulted on payments. Should Management take legal action to recover receivables and at what stages the law allowed debts as unrecoverable and to be written off?  6. What are the rules and regulations to safeguard abuse/misuse by Management/Executive to write off debts by related or friendly parties as impairment? 23/07/2021 10:41 AM"

SERBADK,PSAi3alert,254 posts,2021-07-23 14:03:00,"--- Discussion holiday from Serba ---  Sslee, I will guess motherhood apple pie answers will be given.  Selling off the loss-making subsidiary for RM1 has provided the optics for an improved balance sheet and gives time for the company to smooth out the write-offs against earnings from the other profitable venture.  What is not visible, however, is the value of the previous subsidiary's tax losses. Four times ( 1/25%) of the accumulated losses can be used for channeling in pre-tax profits.  If transactions were to be undertaken to reap the benefits of the accumulated losses, and in parallel to the write-offs by the previous majority shareholder, secret profits would have been made. The party that has enjoyed the secret profits will become constructive trustee ( see also FHR Ventures v Cedar Capital ), and there is no statute of limitation for trust property.  The proper route that the Management should take is to get a judgment debtor sum and apply a garnishee order to attach the ex-subsidiary's bank accounts. In order to assess whether the Management will choose this route, I will do searches on the ex-subsidiary and the ex-subsidiary's now main shareholder's accounts and will zoom in on the names of officers and date of tabling of the last financial results.    Sslee Guess what Bursa reply me on below questions?  5. Impairment of trade receivables and other receivable bases on customers/related parties that are in financial difficulties and have defaulted on payments. Should Management take legal action to recover receivables and at what stages the law allowed debts as unrecoverable and to be written off?  6. What are the rules and regulations to safeguard abuse/misuse by Management/Executive to write off debts by related or friendly parties as impairment? 23/07/2021 10:41 AM"

Malaysia going to have 1 million cases in just a few more day. Is it really not following sop the primary reason ? I doubt it. Malaysians have been under lock down before nothing has changed but cases going up. What's not constant is the new variants. I believe the variants are what's causing covid to be much more infectious. Nothing to do with fully blaming Malaysians not following sop. We can only follow so much sop. But if the variant is so infections that any surface u come into contact with that has covid on it will most certainly cause u to get infected also.  If this trend continues, I believe we will see a day where everyone go out need to wear gloves also when touching surfaces. If the vaccines become less effective and the variants continue. This thing is going to go exponential. The initial variant of covid is not the same as the current delta and other variants.  On stocks selection, a successful breakout above downtrend line hurdle at RM4.13 will lift TOPGLOV (HLIB Research-BUY-TP RM6.66) share price higher towards the next barriers at RM4.26-4.58 levels (Supports: RM3.64-3.85), underpinned by bottoming up technicals. Likewise, the strong reclaim above 10d & 20d SMAs could spur SUPERMX (RM3.50, Notrated) share prices higher towards the next hurdles at RM3.65-3.95 levels.

The world's worst coronavirus outbreak may have claimed as many as 5 million lives in India. India’s actual death toll from Covid-19 could range between 1.3 million to a staggering 5 million, with even the most conservative estimate putting its tally at more than double the U.S., the highest recorded in the world so far. While under-reporting of Covid fatalities is a global phenomenon, the problem is aggravated in India because deaths were already poorly counted before the pandemic. India's Covid death is 10X under reported. Nobody expected Delta variant to be so deadly. And yet globally its only warming up and have yet to unleash its full force yet.  Mayo Clinics: Delta variants infections will surge for months to come in the US. Delta is going to hit the low vaccinated states in US hard. Will be explosive as mentioned before due to cover ups and under reporting.

These numbers act as a warning to everyone how much infections are happening around where. So ppl will be more careful. The fact that high numbers of new cases are detected means there are breakouts and necessary actions need to be taken to by Authorities to reduce the infection rates. This is so important as a matter of controlling the pandemic. Only the politicians and dumbdonkeys want to cover up to make things look good.

Even after this Delta wave, many of these countries will go on record stock piling to prepare for the next more powerful variant wave next year.

SUPERMX,gemfinder,5437 posts,2021-07-25 11:20:00,"Dr. Jamalludin, however, said the vaccines had shown to be effective in protecting people from a severe form of the Covid-19 virus.  “Two doses of Comirnaty (Pfizer) and AstraZeneca can protect 88% and 60% respectively from the Delta variant, and it can prevent hospitalisation up to 96%,” he added.  As such, he said the vaccination rollout played a pivotal role in ensuring the Delta variant did not undermine recovery efforts.  “Our vaccine rollout now is among the best in Asia, if not in the world. More than 15% of the population have received two doses and it is important to fully vaccinate more than 50%.  “However, we may see its effect only later. Perhaps not in terms of the number of positive cases, but the number of hospital admissions and deaths,” he said."

I have been warning them of this impending huge wave since 3 months back in early May, even before Delta got its name, but their macai, ie Aunty GloveFinish and MoneyMakers never took heed and kept attacking me and didn't inform their bosses to quickly cover short positions earlier. So I think their bosses must have lockdown their pay, so they have no incentive to post here anymore until the get their pay. I think this time the shortists will be in trouble if they don't quickly cover back as the Delta is moving faster than they expected. This Delta has caught everyone by surprise, including the shortists. In fact this time round, the retailers are acting faster than the shortists. Anyway, all glove supporters should continue to #HoldSupermax>5.0  #HoldSupermax>5.0"

Falls in antibodies after vaccination are expected and do not necessarily mean people are more vulnerable to disease, but the researchers are concerned that if the declines persist the effectiveness of the vaccines may diminish.

It's a problem that could last for months, straining the country's economic recovery and weighing on global trade.  Several Chinese provinces have said they are facing a power crunch in recent weeks, including some of the country's most important engines for economic growth. Guangdong province — a manufacturing center responsible for $1.7 trillion, or more than 10%, of China's annual economic output and a bigger share of its foreign trade — has been rationing power for over a month. The restrictions have forced companies across the province to shut down for a few days per week. Some local authorities are warning that power rationing could last through the end of the year. It's not just Guangdong. At least nine provinces have said they are dealing with similar issues, including Yunnan, Guangxi and the manufacturing hub of Zhejiang, forcing regional authorities to announce power curbs across an area of China the size of the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan combined.  https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/30/economy/china-power-shortage-intl-h...

Better than FD 4. potential OGM deals updates, with coming wave the urgency for strategic supply chain will be higher. 5. potential US expansion update. Such expansion would now be seen as a smart move in light of halted operation due to EMCO. Cannot put too many eggs in one basket. 6. Potential suspension of RSS due to worsening economic conditions for retailers. 580,000 MSME owners will collapse if lockdown persist. Many of them likely to be retailers at Bursa. FM need to assist by suspending RSS like last year. 7.Covid coming big wave could wreck havoc to the global healthcare system worse than previous waves. ASP may start rising again due to acute glove shortage. Remember 80% of the global population have not been vaccinated yet. This time it will hit many more countries which were spared in previous waves much harder, and infect wider demographics of the population, therefore glove demand from these new markets will be exponential.  With PE of 2.5 at current price, there's nothing much too lose. Whereas all other sectors will be hard hit, gloves will continue to earn supernormal profits.  #HARI HARI NAIK SIKIT SIKIT, LAMA LAMA JADI BUKIT"

The Delta variant is the most contagious version yet of the coronavirus. It accounts for 83 percent of infections in the United States, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a Senate hearing on Tuesday.  The variant may also be mainly responsible for a recent rise in infections: Although they are still low relative to last winter, cases are rising in all 50 states, and hospitalizations are increasing in nearly all of them. In the two weeks ending on Tuesday, the nation averaged 268 deaths per day.  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/health/coronavirus-johnson-vaccine-..."

This new strain is also thought to be more destructive than the Delta variants detected in India last year.  Though data is scarce, one preliminary study by a group of researchers from Chile reveals that the Lambda variant has increased transmissibility and immune escape potential, and 7 mutations – which mean that it is likely more contagious, and our bodies may not detect it at all, making it more deadly.  https://thesmartlocal.com/malaysia/lambda-variant-covid/"

Anything happen to the machine will reduce the sales volume & profit thus affecting the share price. Dnex should push the share price up fast so can sell pp with higher price. Dnex should proceed with the pp to buy new wafer machine. A new DUV wafer machine of 28nm from ASML easily cost US100M whereas new EUV of 7nm cost about US500M to US1B each."

DNEX,Gerard Lam,100 posts,2021-07-23 16:05:00,"Due to many misinformation spread by less competent individuals above, there are a few facts to clarify:  1. Stock is heavy, thus price hard to rise - Outstanding WD not converted is 215mil WD's. Assuming all 215mil WD are converted by end of the month, the total share base of DNeX will be ~3.1bil shares.  2. Who are the sellers? - Based on CGS-CIMB report on fund flow, DNeX's recent share price rise in this week was due to proprietary buying. Proprietary buyers are funds that buy (not on behalf of investors), but direct buyers to earn gains for themself/the firm. These are mainly large investment banks  3. Net buyers for last 2 weeks and one month - institution and proprietary funds were net buyers while retailers were net sellers.  4. Assuming DNeX earns RM200mil for FY21 (RM80mil Silterra, RM70mil Ping, RM50mil Others), at conservative PE of 20x, DNeX is worth RM1.29. At peak valuation PE of 60x, DNeX is worth RM3.88  This explains why institution and proprietary funds kept mopping up DNeX shares from retailers."

Moreover, writer has no respect for the BOD and also no awareness of market sentiments.  P/S Not a Buy or Sell call, trade at your own Risks."

DNEX,Gerard Lam,100 posts,2021-07-24 14:27:00,"Based on SMIC's quarter 1 results will show that SMIC's 200mm wafer fab revenue increase by ~29% from Q420 to Q121 (almost entire increase due to increase in ASP instead of capacity, as SMIC's capacity has maxed out at 98% based on the disclosure). Note that SMIC's revenue are entirely 200mm wafer  Back to Silterra, at 64% capacity for 2020, Silterra achieved RM568mil revenue for 2020.  A simple back on the envelope calculation: RM568mil / 64% x 92% (Current Silterra capacity) = RM816.5mil  Assuming 75% of Silterra's 200mm wafers had 20% ASP increase (conservative compared to SMIC): (RM816.5mil x 75% x 1.2) + (RM816.5 x 25% x 1.0) = RM939mil (Silterra 2021 conservative revenue)  How about profitability? Note that Silterra is and has been EBITDA positive, which means that they are generating positive cash flows. So why Profit after tax is negative? This is due to RM100mil depreciation per year. However, after Silterra is acquired by DNeX, the useful lives of the assets of RM100mil book value will be re-measured (as machines for 200mm wafer fab have increased useful lives due to current market shortage)  Thus, depreciation will fall to RM10mil per year (based on RM100mil book value of assets)  Based on reduced depreciation, ASP and capacity increase, Silterra can easily turn the 2020's loss of RM64mil into profit of more than RM300mil from:  - Revenue increase by more than RM350mil - Depreciation fall by more than RM80mil  In conclusion, Silterra's simple and conservative back of envelope calculation shows it could easily make RM150mil - RM250mil profit after tax this year.  Based on DNeX's 60% stake in Silterra, at 60x PE (Semiconductor), Silterra's value alone to DNeX is RM2.32  RM200mil (PAT) / 3.1bil shares (fully diluted) = RM0.039 (EPS)  60 PE x RM0.039 (EPS) = RM2.32  This is only current year earnings, not including Silterra's future growth prospects in MEMS and Silicon Photonics in Electric vehicles and Data centres.  This is the reason foreign investment banks and proprietary investment funds have been buying so confidently from retailers."

Average USD11.56/year. Based on report from Hibiscus, the production output from Anasuria Cluster will increase by about 10% in 2021 and the average crude oil price in 2021 is USD 63.2 and improving. From 1/7/2021, the projected Crude oil is expected to be USD70 pb ( increase by 10%). It is acceptable to expect the net profit for Ping in 2nd half of 2021 by 20% =  11.56 x 1.2 = (USD13.872/ 4 quarters) x 0.9 = USD 3.1212 million ( RM13.2 million per quarter).

DNEX,fengpinglangjin,461 posts,2021-07-20 14:17:00,"We are excited to announce that CapBay has recently signed an Memorandum of Understanding with China Construction Bank (CCB), SealNet (Dnex subsidiary) and Labuan DAC.  ""CapBay will supplement the Regional Single Window (RSW) ecosystem with an e-trade financing platform to present Malaysian SMEs with better access to trade financing while SealNet will connect the RSW to importers, exporters, manufacturers and trade-related businesses.""   The MoU cloud signing was witnessed by a senior representative of the Embassy of PRC in Malaysia. Read on the article by The Edge Markets to know more about this latest collaboration.  https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/china-construction-bank-makes-m...#  LABUAN (July 15): China Construction Bank (Malaysia) Bhd (CCBM) and China Construction Bank Corporation Labuan Branch (CCBL) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with three firms to build a comprehensive “regional single window” (RSW) digital platform to facilitate trade.  The RSW has been mooted to promote international trade facilitation with major trading partner nations and to assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in export and import financing through an ecosystem approach. It is an artificial intelligence-based trade facilitation digital platform that connects trade finance, insurance and logistics in one single marketplace.  In a statement to Bernama today, CCBL said the three firms — SealNet Sdn Bhd, Bay Supply Chain Technology Sdn Bhd (CapBay) and Labuan Digital Authentication Centre Inc (DAC) — signed the MoU on Wednesday, witnessed by Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (EXIM Bank).  Advertisement  CCBM chief executive officer Felix Feng Qi, SealNet representative Datuk Patrick Wong, CapBay executive director Ang Xing Xian and DAC director Datuk Tee Ting Cham signed the document in a ceremony.    To complement the RSW, the Chinese banking group’s smart matchmaking platform — CCB Match Plus —- will integrate domestic and international data to facilitate the matching of cross-border merchandise.  CapBay will supplement the RSW ecosystem with an e-trade financing platform to present Malaysian SMEs with better access to trade financing while SealNet will connect the RSW to importers, exporters, manufacturers and trade-related businesses.  During the ceremony, EXIM Bank’s officer-in-charge Chin Chon Young said in a joint statement that the MoU signified “the start of an exciting development for the exporters and importers in Malaysia as the RSW is designed with convenience and financial accessibility in mind, backed by digital technology”.  CCBM deputy general manager Wang Qijie said CCBM has shown support for the establishment of the RSW.  “By having direct linkage, it would create a business value chain for our customers where a match-made business in CCB Match Plus could flow through seamlessly to the RSW for transaction execution,” he said.  SealNet’s Wong said the company is looking to address the “pain points” that have hindered efficiency and led to unnecessary costs in the industry.  “SealNet is built to bridge global supply chains and logistics to enhance the efficiency of transport and trade facilitation mechanisms, to improve the productivity of freight logistics, and to provide a better electronic system for logistics and cross-border trade.  “Customers, big and small, can have easy and secured access to SealNet’s digital trade platform anytime, anywhere to enjoy time and cost savings, as well as operate in real-time with data accuracy,” he said.  In 2020, Malaysia’s total exports represented 26% of its GDP, compared with 22.1% in 2019.  “With the growing export trend, the RSW will further support and create a strong foundation to ease and cultivate additional trades within the region. Under the MoU, by leveraging on the expertise of the partners, the parties will collaboratively build a comprehensive trade financing credit model as the key component to support the e-trade financing platform,” he added.  Collaborating partners also agree to work together in the area of linking CCB Match Plus to the RSW ecosystem, with CCBM to handle clearings and settlements behind the scenes."

The Main course is of course..Silterra, passed over this National Treasure by Khazanah for Dnex to perform the patriotic duties to hold and caress this beauty and awaken her extraordinary features, showcasing outstanding products and to provide synergies to the EVs of the futures. MEMS and Senors, downstream value-added semicond chips.  Anticipating the makeover, upgrading and profitability turnaround also captured the eyes and piqued the interest of one of the world's top 4 Semicond Company..(you already know who)  Khazanah had pumped in no less than RM8 billions but the Selling price is for a song, only for the one, Dnex. It is a ""No Lost"" deal with so many others lined up at the bidding, only to fall on the laps and loving hands of Dnex. (Sell outright now and make RM300-350 millions)  We await with quivering hands of excitements, similar to a 16 year old going out for a first date.

The approved 30% new PP, as mentioned by Tan Sri Dato Syed Zainal, would be placed in tranches and on when necessary basis. Also, we are quite certain, they would not be going out in a lump 30% and ONLY to 1 Buyer.  Some of it may be negotiated with the Fox, but we do not see them taking the whole 30%, even though, they wished very much for. They currently have a shareholding of 4.27% and the threshold/bar for Mandatory MBO, cannot and MUST not be breached. Truth sucks...  Should the turnaround be successful undertaken, and the Fox are satisfied with the chips for their supply chain, we may witness professional co-operations and harmony. Otherwise, sparks would be uncalled for.  For better or for worse, in health and in sickness...the Fox is in the chicken house.  Sorry to disappoint with Truth and Thank you."

DNEX,Trevor777,1031 posts,2021-07-18 14:16:00,"Another Fact with Figures we like to share and for your Sunday afternoon nap bedside story :  From April 2021, Tan Sri Dato Syed Zainal has been smiling in his sleep every night. He has no worries and no stress for financial support, and in fact, he knows where and how to get them ""when necessary"".  Dnex is married to the Fox on the top rung and on the subsidiary, Dnex Semiconductor Sdn Bhd, have the chinese CGP and their Investment arms on standby. Both financial muscles are more than ready and can lift heavy duties like feathers and readied with ease on support like a knife cutting through butter.  Fox pulled in USD178 Billions in Revenues in 2019, reported in their 2020 Financial Accounting. For Malaysia, our Malaysian International Reserves, in Gold, Forex and the International Monetary Funds, totaled USD109.3 Billions in April, 2020. (now probable less in 2021)  Fox's President Terry Guo is a philanthropist and showed his patriotism 2 weeks ago when Fox obtained approval from the Taiwanese Govt to accept from their generosity, USD350 million (RM1.45 Billion) worth of Pfizer vaccines. He may just with a nod or a wave of his hand and not necessary to say ""Get it in"" and Dnex is his for the taking.  Dnex NOSH may be at 3.8 Billion and market cap at RM2.85 Billion (present vulnerable Mart price 75c) based on all Warrants and PP be completed. At the wave of a hand, shareholders like us may receive a ""Notice of Purchase"" from Fox to buy whatever shares they do not own yet.  https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bnm-international-reserves-us10...."

It was as light as a feather, and even the market price was up 3.5 sens. It may seems like an increase of a small token sum but the buying sprees, sporadically snapping up the Sellers in blocks of 50 - 300 lots was pleasurable to watch. Hoping for more from Dnex in the coming week.  Stay safe and be well, have a nice weekend."

They make it a “debt” so they can repay shareholders 8% per annum otherwise just straight do a normal rights issue which is easier. Why the hassle? Because they need to reward those who believe in them including all the other MAJOR and minor SHAREHOLDERS.   They even allow you to sell it back to them at cost price from 4th year onwards. So ask the so hai. How can you lose money? Always get info from reliable sources not from trolls who bark simply and spread dumbness.   I say spread dumbness not spread lies anymore because I realized they actually are not lying. They just don’t even know they are wrong.

AIRASIA,In_Sight,261 posts,2021-07-21 19:58:00,Do you know what’s the meaning of filing for bankruptcy? Go study first. AA won’t file for bankruptcy. A good management will never do that. AA can sell of their business or businesses. Worst case scenario just like how they able to sell of their leasing companies / plane maintenance division /  travel magazine & media company etc to create cash and value for the company and pay out as special dividend all these years. Their digital company already valued at rm1 billion usd. More than enough to cover 4 times for the rights issue price even if fully subscribe. How to bankrupt? So hai no study only will think about bankrupt.   If AA share price drop to 0.005 also you can surrender back at rm0.75 do you even read? That’s the terms of the RCUIDS. How to lose money if sell back same price? Fail maths.   Yeah its so unsecured that the owner underwrite their commitments to subscribe to it. OMG “UNSECURED LOAN” MUST BE VERY UNSECURED.   Really dumb. Anyway I’m putting this out hopefully those who ask get more information from reliable sources ya not from this hopelessly dumb ass hole.

Especially PP investors which include urusharta jemaah which is and arm of Ministry of Finance.   Just go read the news/interview why they choose to invest in AA.

AIRASIA,SMGaspar,1 post,2021-07-22 13:44:00,"Man talk about pessimist in this forum. This is pure logic AA will do well in the mid to long term. Borders will be open before year end if not sooner as our vaccination rates are pretty good. London will possibly be the first long haul to start both nations having vaccination programmes in full force.  Point to seriously consider is that all carriers are facing the same dilemma and it is not any sense of bad management. The operators are just as eager to roam the skies, not anymore or perhaps less than the average enthusiast who wants to travel.  AA on the other hand was acquired for pittance as an ailing operation. TF build this on blood, sweat and tears. So I take it that this is a baby in a cradle that he keeps very close to. The pandemic teaches us that fly by night friends are plentiful, dime by the dozen to be precise.  So for every single digit lot traders here who are winging, gripping or drooling there are those hundred lot unsung heroes who have braced for take off. Seriously, thinking seems to be a trait that is hard to come by.   So if you are number crunching here, it makes absolutely no sense analysing that for the reason stated above. If the operators such as Air Asia are subjected to the nuances of present day, so are the leasing conglomerates, so are those who build aircraft.

Is my understanding correct?

Don’t need to pay again to convert.  You can also sell when it’s listed at whatever the quoted market price is or sell back to AA at the same price for rm0.75  You basically WILL NOT lose money.  You are guaranteed 8% per annum for 7 years. However you can convert to mother share anytime from 4th year onwards. Once converted you will not get the 8% anymore from the remaining year(s).  For every two rcuids you also get one free warrant. ______________________________________________________________________________  My answer above in the context of his question.

The world is already accepting to live with covid already. Treat it like normal flu. As long as enough people are vaccinated then we should be able to move on. To those non believers and think lockdown is forever, be a man walk your talk don’t get vaccinated ya. Save the vaccines for people who wants to live a normal life.  There are dozens of antiviral medicines and immune system regulator that comes in form of inhalers showed positive signs in curing covid in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Phase 3 will begin soon. If just any one of them goes all in phase 3 we will begin to see FDA approving them for use next year. I hope at least one will work out of the dozens that are under trials. Then more lives can be saved and we will go back to normal. Scientists are working hard around the clock for this while you are reading this.   Finally i think AA share price will crash when we are 70% vaccinated or when domestic/international borders open. AA will also crash harder when all its digital ventures creates value and begin to earn revenue. AA will also become bankrupt when there is finally a cure for covid. /s"

So many naive ppl here. Lol.   Don’t get tricked guys. Delta fear is over is the western countries. More contagious but not more severe. Vaccines work. Those vaccinated test positive have dead virus in the nose. They are asymptomatic because the vaccine protect them from it becoming a disease. Go read more about B cells and T cells that’s effective against covid and viruses in general. Can see at UK or US even positive test high but hospitalization and deaths remain low and those numbers are largely from the unvaccinated population. Which so hai last month say UK going to lock down forever? They already fully open and celebrate. Canada open its borders to fully vaccinated travellers without need for quarantine. Asean is slow because of the vaccine supply that is slow to reach here. More supplies will be available soon. It’s the matter of time we get our lives back. Hang on! We’ll be back sooner than other Asean countries. AA will grab more market share domestically.  However, all being said there’s one really bad news:-   https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/japan-first-country-approve-...  The above is just one of the many drugs that’s ongoing third phase clinical trials. Those negative people either have no understanding of today’s medical technology or is sour grape and hope that no cure can ever be found and hope more people will die.   Like many of the negative gang assumed, AA price will crash when 70% vaccination or when there’s cure for covid. Since Malaysia is vaccinating the fastest rate in the WORLD and Japan starts using this drug for general population, I guess the crash is really coming soon. /s"

AIRASIA,In_Sight,261 posts,2021-07-21 14:11:00,@machoman888   You only pay one time rm0.75 for the rcuids. Don’t need to pay again to convert.   You can also sell when it’s listed at whatever the quoted market price is or sell back to AA at the same price for rm0.75  You basically WILL NOT lose money.   You are guaranteed 8% per annum for 7 years. However you can convert to mother share anytime from 4th year onwards. Once converted you will not get the 8% anymore from the remaining year(s).   For every two rcuids you also get one free warrant.

He said the July 26 Parliament sitting will be the best platform to discuss this important strategy, which is vital to fight the raging pandemic in the country, with daily figures creating fear among Malaysians.   Lim, who is Iskandar Puteri MP, said the parliamentary select committee for health, science and innovation, which is meeting next Friday, should be entrusted with the task of drafting a new policy for the nation to make the transition to the “Live with Covid-19” perspective.   “The committee should invite health experts from both the public and private sectors to give their views on the elements of the policy as Malaysia must move away from the blind faith in lockdowns.   “We can change from ‘no-Covid-19’ to ‘living with Covid-19’ but there is no one strategy and approach which can be used for all countries.   “At present, Singapore and the United Kingdom are the two countries with diametrically different strategies which have opted for the latter,” he said in a statement today.   Lim said this new strategy must embrace two important elements, namely the restoration of public trust and confidence and an “all-of-government” and “whole-of-society” mobilisation, which was missing in the last 18 months."

AIRASIA,In_Sight,261 posts,2021-07-17 12:26:00,"To all shareholders here and Tianchoi no need waste time response to them. You owe nobody any explanation and don’t have to prove them anything. It’s your own money anyway. They always think ppl buy high. In fact many of us here bought during the dip last year. They always assume things. They only want to justify their insecure brains cos they don’t hold any of AA shares. They worry that AA will handle this crisis well and make it through this pandemic better than they thought. They worry they misjudged AA. They worry their ego will be beaten down to drain cos they are wrong.    I’d only be worried if whatever they said materialized. But non.  They’ve been calling crash from private placement to fmco to 10k cases to extend fmco to delta variant to AA no cash to Rights Issue.   Rights Issue announced still no crash. Dunno why they think it will crash, it was expected RI to happen all along. There was no secret about it. Why they act as though they are surprised? Funny ppl. Price adjusted because of the possible enlarged share base. More shares = market cap increase if price don’t adjust. So price adjustment is normal. Not rocket science but some people here use it to feed their ego. Btw this RI is very fair. No brainer to not subscribe. You won’t lose your capital at all unlike other RI. Got 8% p.a and can surrender back at rm0.75 so you are guaranteed at least 8% pa and any capital gains from conversion with free warrants. Go figure.  So again when will the price crash? Let’s take a guess. Maybe when klang valley fully vaccinated by august 1st? Until mco lifted? Until gov allow fully vaccinated people to move freely including interstate? Until more vaccines are easily available? Until the drug trials for cure success third phase trial and get FDA approval for use? Or until interstate ban is lifted? Borders open? Then only price will crash?  /s  Got to give credit to the management who never give up no matter what. Raise fund, accelerate digital ventures to create value. They are working hard and doing so much. All these takes time. But hey, haters gonna hate.   There are so many positive signs which we don’t need to elaborate. If you know, you know. Road ahead definitely still bumpy but the worst is definitely over.   However only fools want it today. They want you to buy today and prove them the price will increase today. Not sure why. Even they are more restless and less patient than us the shareholders. Funny.   That being said I’m not 100% forever stick to AA. I only believe in what they are doing now and that life will go back to normal sooner rather than later and i believe AA is a strong recovery stock. At any point in my investment if i feel not happy with the management direction i’d be happy to sell them and look for better opportunities. But as for now. I highly think that they will pull it through and come back stronger.   See you in the skies~~"

AIRASIA,Will76,574 posts,2021-07-15 13:18:00,"The Star Online : Asia’s air travel may take three years to recover from pandemic  ASIAN air travel may take another three years to recover fully from the devastation wrought by the pandemic, lagging behind rebounds in other regions and offering a stern headwind for refiners making jet fuel.  It’ll take until 2024 for international air travel across the region to reach pre-virus levels, a year after global traffic hits that milestone, according to the International Air Transport Association. Similarly, consultancy Energy Aspects says jet fuel consumption will reach pre-pandemic volumes only in 2023-2024.  The drawn-out timelines highlight the difficulties facing Asia and the likely consequences for jet fuel, a traditionally prized part of the oil-products market. Low rates of vaccination in many countries, the challenge posed by the fast-spreading delta variant, and persistent lockdowns have all set back the recovery even as the U.S. and Europe press on. All that means Asia’s aviation industry is unlikely to offer significant support to the region’s hard-pressed refineries, which process crude from the Middle East and elsewhere into fuels.  Both North America and Europe have seen strong demand during the holidays, with the European Union relaxing quarantine and lockdown requirements, according to Mayur Patel, regional sales director for Japan and Asia Pacific at OAG, an aviation analytics firm. ""Sadly, the same cannot be said for Asia, where the low level of vaccination rates, sudden and sharp lockdowns, and inconsistent regulations frustrate any real attempt at a recovery, ” he said.  Just this week, Indonesia -- the largest economy in Southeast Asia -- surpassed India’s tally of daily cases, marking a new center for the highly-contagious delta variant. Elsewhere, Malaysia has been struggling to contain a recent outbreak, Seoul in South Korea has imposed its toughest restrictions yet, and Japan is preparing to host the Olympic Games without spectators.  Bubble Trouble  While there have been signs some countries including Singapore are rethinking their Covid-zero stance to open up, it’s likely international travel will still take longer than the rest of the world to restart. Australia’s plan to launch a quarantine-free travel bubble with the city-state is now more likely to occur only by the end of the year, according to an Australian diplomat.  ""We expect passenger traffic for international Asia-Pacific to restart in early 2022 at the earliest, ” an IATA spokesperson said in an email interview. ""We don’t think that the variant situation will improve, so governments are unlikely to start lifting controls before vaccination becomes sufficiently widespread to limit community contagion.”  That means a longer struggle for Asian refiners. Given the differentiated recovery, some processors have been looking to Europe and the U.S. as outlets for jet fuel, shipping more to both regions. With lackluster demand, the margin for making jet fuel in Asia has sunk to $5.99 a barrel at Wednesday’s close compared with $15.54 in December 2019, Bloomberg Fair Value data show.  Asia’s jet fuel usage accounted for a third of global consumption in 2019, according to Energy Aspects. Right now, the region’s overall flight numbers -- domestic and international -- are 70% of pre-virus levels, but if China is excluded are only 40%, according to George Dix, an analyst. ""We currently expect Asian jet demand will not reach pre-pandemic levels until 2023-2024, although domestic travel will have largely recovered by the end of 2022.”  Given the challenges, regional refiners will continue to redirect kerosene, which includes jet fuel, into the gasoil pool this quarter, aiming to tap into winter fuel heating demand the following quarter, according to Sri Paravaikkarasu at energy consultancy FGE. ""The full recovery of international air travel has a long way to go, ” she said. - Bloomberg"

Laporan polis dibuat terhadap status media sosial dan artikel yang didakwa menghina Menteri Kesihatan Dr Adham Baba yang tersilap menyebut perkataan Spanish flu (selesema Sepanyol) sebagai ""spanish fly"".  Ia dikatakan dibuat oleh seorang peguam bagi pihak Adham.  Laporan itu dibuat selepas tular video Adham salah menyebut perkataan Spanish flu sebagai Spanish fly dan Spanish virus.  Spanish fly biasanya merujuk kepada perangsang seksual - dikatakan dibuat daripada bahan kimia diekstrak daripada serangga dengan nama sama.  Selesema Sepanyol pula merujuk kepada wabak pada tahun 1918 yang menjangkiti satu pertiga populasi manusia ketika itu.  Sementara itu, laporan polis oleh peguam itu merujuk dua ciapan - gesaan menteri kesihatan dipecat dan perkongsian gambar seniman Fahmi Reza yang menyindir Adham - sebagai menghasut.  Laporan polis itu juga merujuk laporan The Rakyat Post sebagai sengaja mahu memalukan menteri.  The Rakyat Post mengesahkan kepada polis bahawa laporan itu betul.  Ketika dihubungi, polis memberitahu Malaysiakini supaya merujuk perkara itu kepada Suruhanjaya Komunikasi dan Multimedia Malaysia (SKMM).

The Proposed Rights Issue will be implemented on a minimum subscription basis to raise minimum gross proceeds of approximately RM615.9 million (“Minimum Subscription Level”).  The Proposed Rights Issue will not fully address the Group’s current financial concerns as the estimated gross proceeds of up to approximately RM1,024.1 million would not be sufficient to meet its long-term cash flow requirements.

In its recent press release on the cash call, AirAsia said ""it is also well progressed in discussions to secure a number of other fundraising initiatives”. Fernandes in his last interview with The Edge three months ago, had expected to secure RM1 billion in loans from three Malaysian banks, pending approval from local regulators under the Danajamin guarantee scheme.   However the RM2 billion to RM2.5 billion fund-raising proposed by AirAsia at the onset of the pandemic only incorporated funding until end-2021"

MAR 27, 2021 11:50 AM [KUALA LUMPUR] AirAsia Group expects to secure RM1 billion (S$324.7 million) in loans from three Malaysian banks, pending approval from local regulators, group chief executive Tony Fernandes said in a report by The Edge Malaysia.  The budget airline said last week it had raised US$82 million through private share placements, in a bid to ensure liquidity in 2021.  Mr Fernandes said the airline expected to have a ""clear line of sight"" by June on how much funding they will be able to raise, which he estimated to be between RM2 billion and RM2.5 billion.  ""What I'm confirming by the way is that banks have approved part of the RM1 billion but Danajamin hasn't approved,"" Mr Fernandes was quoted as saying in an interview with The Edge, referring to the government's financial guarantee insurer."

AIRASIA,trum,5974 posts,2021-07-14 10:35:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (July 14): The highly-anticipated cash call from AirAsia Group Bhd has received different reactions from analysts covering the budget airline, with some highly supportive of the mechanism involved, while others opined that the RM1.02 billion proceeds is not enough to support its cash flow requirement.  As investors shared optimism on the future projected returns from the rights issue, a major uncertainty looms. AirAsia has not received the undertaking from its co-founders (and chief executive officer and chairman) Tan Sri Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Meranun for their portion of the rights issue.  When it announced the fund raising exercise on Monday (July 12), AirAsia said it intends to secure the undertakings from the duo, who control 26.4% in the company and have the right to subscribe to RM257.27 million or 25.1% of the intended RM1.02 billion fund-raising.  Concurrently, AirAsia also seeks to secure underwriters for half of the rights issue not to be subscribed by the duo – representing RM358.62 million or 35% of the total fund-raising."

RCUID @ rm0.75 convertible to 1 to 1 mother share and it will be listed can be traded in open market. Instant discount earned. It will be closely traded to AA share or even on a premium because of the 8% per annum profit rate that’s attached to it.   If don’t want to sell can keep and convert to AA mother share at a later available to be announced date and will be entitled for future voting rights/dividend etc or even sell as mother share.   If plan to keep RCUID can earn 8% profit per annum paid quarterly for 7 years. More than any of your FD / epf funds.   1 free warrant capped at rm1 exercise price or 20% below 30days average whichever is lower for every 2 RCUIDS. Forgot when is the exercise date i think is after 7 years. Didn’t pay much attention to this because Hello it’s free. Also AA price will not likely to stay below rm1 seven years later. Just keep in the fridge and enjoy after 7 years. Nothing to lose it’s FREE. Also this warrant is separated from the RCUID. Even you sold your RCUID you still can keep and trade your warrant seperately.  Management to procure unconditional written underwriting from founders (tony and kamarudin) to fully subscribe 100% of their rights and additional 50% of rights that are not subscribe (if any) to meet the minimum fund target raising. Owners are paying own money even if you don’t subscribe. Well they should know more about how their company is doing more than anyone of us. So this move is a vote of confidence. Worth applauding.   There will be no extra shares issued for LTIS (long term incentive schemes) for the management or staff before the entitlement date. Fair play!   Potentially extra 33% (maximum scenario) shares issued for this RI exercise if fully subscribed which i think very likely but today drop 5%. If you know your maths you know that the price should adjust more accordingly and is actually holding strong.   Only dickymee who dunno how to calculate or read proper QR thinks that today share price drop 5% is a lost. I bet he don’t even understand the whole thing.  Also only kids look or brag at one day price performance. Lets see who’s having the last laugh. That’s most important.   The board or CFO or the management or rhb who came up with this idea of RI is a genius. It’s a win win situation for both the shareholders and the company. Way better than expected.   Ofcoz if you are negative no matter what the management does you will think it’s negative.   But hey, where’s the crash? Since lock down to subsequent lock downs to closed border to interstate ban open and ban to delta, delta plus, lamda. Still haven’t crash? What else is coming?   “I think maybe will crash when 50% of population is vaccinated or hospitalization is low and the doctors and nurses are more relaxed and no more white flags… that time maybe will crash la.. so carefuly ya… /s”"
AIRASIA,Karlos,854 posts,2021-07-13 21:35:00,"As I wrote earlier the RI for RCUIDS at 75 sen is very attractive. The interest rate for the security (RCUIDS) is 8% per annum for 7 years, way above of what we can get from our FD, EPF or even unit most trusts. As additional benefit we can always convert it into ordinary share if we want at 1 to 1 without paying any additional money at 75 sen only, the cost of RCUIDS. Another additional benefit of subscribing to RCUIDS, we will get free warrants too."

Is not the Vaccination of the entire Population already BUDGETTED FOR ? With all the money needed..even the 70 plus million Ringgit for the IT Infrastructure/ System ?       AND THE USING OF THE NATIONAL TRUST FUND ??     WHY must some members of Society be made to PAY for what should be FREE?    Is not Vaccinating of the Population a Healthcare Service to the Rakyat ?     Was not the TOTAL requirements all calculated, and planned for, to be delivered Free to the Rakyat ?      It is a very strange situation that there is different treatment amongst the Rakyat  by the Government.    NOT EVERYONE can AFFORD to PAY to  Vaccinate a Family, especially when those still unvaccinated,  are those most affected by the various incoherent Lockdowns !    AND MAKING COMPANIES PAY to Vaccinate their Employees,  is the SUREST WAY  to  encourage AVOIDANCE ( due to costs ..especially WHEN THE BUSINESSES HAVE UNDER LOCKDOWN !! And have NOT had any REVENUE coming in !)      The END result would be greater spread of Covid INFECTIONS...as many would NOT be Vaccinated !      Can the Chairman of the Vaccination Committee please Explain?     NO ONE  should MAKE MONEY from the Vaccines!.      It is A BLATANT ABUSE OF MONOPOLY STATUS , when one COMPANY is GIVEN the RIGHT to "" FILL and FINISH "" the SINOVAC Vaccine...adding MORE COSTS ( in the name of "" value add"").     WOULD IT NOT BE CHEAPER to just IMPORT SINOVAC, FROM CHINA, in its ready- to - use  state?    We could probably GET A DISCOUNT from CHINA !!!      I REPEAT...

PHARMA,trum,5974 posts,2021-07-23 14:38:00,"Malaysia apologizes for ‘human error’ over empty Covid-19 vaccine jab TheEdge Fri, Jul 23, 2021 01:54pm - 37 minutes ago View Original   (July 23): Malaysia has confirmed one case of an individual being injected with an empty syringe in its national vaccination rollout, categorizing it as a human error.  The government further identified two cases where individuals were given an extra dose of the Coronavirus vaccine due to confusion, said Science, Technology, and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin in a briefing Friday.  “Even if there’s one single error, that’s one error too much,” said Khairy. “So for those cases where there was human negligence, I apologize to them. And of course we will do better.”  Follow our Covid-19 vaccination tracker to see where we are in the race to herd immunity.    The one case of “empty vaccination”, which occurred in the northern state of Kedah, was confirmed after the nurse admitted she was negligent due to exhaustion, said Khairy. Disciplinary action would be taken against her, he said. The two individuals who received extra jabs were allowed to do so as it was unclear if they had initially been administered empty syringes, he added.  Thirteen police reports have been lodged so far on the matter, with most of them found to be false or inconclusive, said Khairy. The country has administered 16,024,916 million doses of the Covid vaccine, according to the Health Ministry on Friday.  In future, recipients are permitted to record their vaccination process to prevent this from happening, said Khairy. This is amid the government’s push to fully vaccinate all adults by October as infections remain elevated. Some 15.6% of the population have received both doses of the vaccine as of Thursday."

PHARMA,trum,5974 posts,2021-07-20 13:38:00,"Poppema, a specialist in immunopathology, said all vaccines, including Sinovac, provide sufficient protection against serious illness or death from Covid-19.  He said all vaccines offer slightly lower protection against the Delta variant, “but they also prevent serious illness caused by this variant”.  Poppema said concerns over Sinovac’s efficacy were also exacerbated by news reports of Covid-19 infections and deaths, including 350 Indonesian health workers contracting the virus.  This, he said, was a “small minority” when compared to the one million healthcare workers vaccinated with Sinovac.  “Very few of them became seriously ill,” he said, adding that the success of the vaccine had been underreported.  He also said the highest numbers of infections with the Delta variant were currently found in the UK, which mostly used the AstraZeneca vaccine, and in European countries (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) and the US (Pfizer and Moderna).  “Does that mean they are not effective? No, it’s the non-vaccinated who are affected, and the small number of vaccinated people who do become infected are not seriously ill,” he told FMT."

He said the July 26 Parliament sitting will be the best platform to discuss this important strategy, which is vital to fight the raging pandemic in the country, with daily figures creating fear among Malaysians.  Lim, who is Iskandar Puteri MP, said the parliamentary select committee for health, science and innovation, which is meeting next Friday, should be entrusted with the task of drafting a new policy for the nation to make the transition to the “Live with Covid-19” perspective.  “The committee should invite health experts from both the public and private sectors to give their views on the elements of the policy as Malaysia must move away from the blind faith in lockdowns.  “We can change from ‘no-Covid-19’ to ‘living with Covid-19’ but there is no one strategy and approach which can be used for all countries.  “At present, Singapore and the United Kingdom are the two countries with diametrically different strategies which have opted for the latter,” he said in a statement today.

Ini disebabkan kebimbangan jangkitan yang dilaporkan di negara lain.  ""Kejadian ini menyebabkan negara-negara ini mengkaji strategi vaksinasi mereka dan dengan demikian telah mengusulkan mencampurkan vaksin dan memberi dos perangsang untuk mengatasi kekurangan (keberkesanan vaksin Sinovac yang ada.   ""Walaupun saya menghormati langkah berhati-hati kerajaan dalam menunggu lebih banyak data sebelum mencampurkan vaksin, kerajaan dapat mempertimbangkan menambah dos Sinovac, pada awalnya sebagai percubaan,"" katanya dalam satu kenyataan di Facebook.  Subramaniam berkata, kerajaan harus proaktif dalam menghasilkan pengetahuan baru sebagai panduan untuk menangani situasi baru.  ""Ini dapat memberikan keyakinan dan perlindungan yang lebih besar kepada mereka yang sudah divaksin dengan Sinovac.  ""Lebih-lebih lagi kebanyakan mereka tidak berpeluang memilih jenis vaksin yang diberikan kepada mereka,"" katanya.  Semalam, kerajaan mengumumkan baki dos Sinovac Covid-19 hanya akan digunakan sebagai dos kedua untuk penerima Sinovac yang ada.  Selepas itu, kerajaan akan menggunakan vaksin Pfizer-Biontech sebagai vaksin Covid-19.  Kerajaan berkata langkah ini bukan bermakna menghentikan penggunaan vaksin Sinovac dan ia masih akan tersedia melalui pasaran swasta.  Subramaniam mendakwa keputusan itu dibuat ketika kebimbangan semakin meningkat mengenai keberkesanan vaksin Sinovac Covid-19, terutama terhadap varian Delta yang makin menular.  ""Negara-negara seperti Chile dan Seychelles dalam beberapa bulan terakhir, telah melaporkan peningkatan jumlah kes Covid-19 walaupun memiliki tahap vaksinasi yang sangat tinggi (antara 65-70 peratus penduduk).  ""Secara kebetulan, Sinovac digunakan secara meluas di Chile manakala Sinopharma digunakan di Seychelles.  Kalau anda terlepas...   PULASAN | Gelap tak hilang, terang tak timbul ""Analisis menunjukkan Sinovac hanya mempunyai keberkesanan 65 peratus terhadap jangkitan simptomatik berbeza dengan keberkesanan Pfizer 96 peratus dan AstraZeneca 92 peratus,"" katanya.  Pun begitu, Subramaniam berkata Sinovac masih mempunyai keberkesanan 87 peratus dalam mencegah kemasukan pesakit Covid-19 ke hospital dan kematian.  ""Data terbaru menunjukkan kedua-dua Pfizer dan AstraZeneca telah menunjukkan perlindungan yang baik terhadap rawatan di hospital dan kematian kepada mereka yang dijangkiti dengan varian Delta.  ""Sayangnya, tidak ada banyak data yang tersedia untuk vaksin Sinovac dan pasukan saintis di belakang Sinovac telah mencadangkan dos ketiga mungkin diperlukan untuk meningkatkan keberkesanannya terhadap varian Delta,"" katanya.

As such, he said the vaccination rollout played a pivotal role in ensuring the Delta variant did not undermine recovery efforts.  “Our vaccine rollout now is among the best in Asia, if not in the world. More than 15% of the population have received two doses and it is important to fully vaccinate more than 50%.  “However, we may see its effect only later. Perhaps not in terms of the number of positive cases, but the number of hospital admissions and deaths,” he said."

Careplus already built new lines that will come into play later this year, and also spent money to buy new accommodation for their workers (more secure, save costs). This private placement will fund additional lines to come in 2022 and 2023. The investments is why so far the dividends from Careplus is quite low compared to other gloves.

CAREPLS,Will76,574 posts,2021-06-21 12:31:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (June 21): PublicInvest Research has downgraded the rubber glove sector to ""neutral"" as it expects average selling prices (ASPs) for the sector to decline gradually in the second half of the year (2H21), following the improving Covid-19 situation in both the largest glove consuming markets, the US and the European Union (EU).  Its analyst Chua Siu Li in a note today cut her earnings forecasts for the sector by 10% to 35% on the back of lower ASP assumptions.  According to her, the improving Covid-19 situations in the US and EU resulted in much lesser urgency for distributors to immediately replenish inventories back to usual levels of two to three months.  “The buyers are adopting a more careful stance currently to avoid locking in purchases at high prices.  “We expect ASPs of gloves to start trending lower in the second half, supported by the improved Covid-19 situation as well as lower raw material prices as tight supply of nitrile butadiene latex continues to ease and [with a] better yield for latex concentrate after the end of the wintering season in May,” she said.  She also noted that glove makers’ commitment to stepping up on their social compliance practices will also translate into higher costs going forward, and she reckoned that it would take time for glove makers to fully pass on the cost increase to buyers, so it should result in margin compression in the near term.  Chua downgraded her rating of Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd to ""neutral"", with a lower target price (TP) of RM3.65.  “We cut our FY21 to FY23 earnings forecasts for Kossan by 37% to 51% to account for the expected decline in ASPs,” she said.  She also maintained her ""neutral"" call on Top Glove Corp Bhd but lowered her TP to RM4.40."

He is more aggressive than Trump. Which means China gloves will soon be off the US market. In fact believe US may have already stop purchasing gloves from China.  This is a huge advantage now for Malaysian Gloves to supply the annual 25B glove demand just for the medical sector.

CAREPLS,Will76,574 posts,2021-06-09 22:51:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (June 9): Top Glove Corp Bhd expects average selling prices (ASPs) of gloves to drop further in the coming month due to weaker demand from the US and lower raw material costs.  Its executive director Lim Cheong Guan noted that the ASP of nitrile gloves fell 20% in Top Glove's third financial quarter ended May 31, 2021 (3QFY21).  ""The ASP adjustment was in line with market pricing trends and lesser sales volume to the US,"" he told a virtual press conference held in conjunction with the announcement of the group's latest quarterly results.   Lim expects lower nitrile latex prices as costs of the raw materials, namely butadiene and acrylonitrile, are expected to decline by 10% and 6% respectively between May and August.  ""A lower natural rubber latex concentrate price is expected in the coming months as the wintering season ended in May 2021, and yields are expected to improve,"" he added.  The world's largest glove manufacturer posted a softer quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) performance for 3QFY21.  Its net profit fell 29.03% to RM2.03 billion from RM2.87 billion for 2QFY21, while revenue shrank 22.42% to RM4.16 billion from RM5.37 billion, as the group was barred from exporting to the US.  The group said the weaker q-o-q performance was owing to a decline in ASPs by 16%, a lower sales quantity following a temporary halt in shipments to the US from Malaysia and higher latex as well as natural rubber latex concentrate prices.  On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, the group’s quarterly net profit jumped almost five times to RM2.04 billion from RM347.9 million a year earlier on a higher revenue.  Revenue climbed to RM4.16 billion for 3QFY21 from RM1.69 billion previously.  Despite the weaker earnings performance, Top Glove declared a dividend of 18 sen a share, including a special dividend of 5.3 sen.  Top Glove gained six sen to close at RM4.84 today, with a market capitalisation of RM39.72 billion. It saw 34.54 million shares traded."

CAREPLS,Taipan,970 posts,2021-06-06 11:05:00,"https://www.mida.gov.my/mida-news/rubber-gloves-to-maintain-double-dig...  Rubber gloves to maintain double-digit growth  31 May 2021  The global demand for rubber gloves is projected to maintain a double-digit growth of between 12% and 15%, backed by the persisted healthcare demand amid the rolling out of the Covid-19 vaccines, said Malaysian Rubber Council (MRC).  MRC CEO Nurul Islam Mohamed Yusoff said the expectations remain high as Malaysia’s export of rubber products continued to chart an upward trajectory since the beginning of the year.  “The global per capita consumption of rubber gloves is expected to increase to 25 pairs in 2021 driven by higher usage of gloves in major Malaysia’s export markets such as the US and Europe as well as large emerging markets, particularly in the Asian region.   “Malaysia’s rubber glove industry will maintain its positive momentum and exports are expected to reach a new high for the full year of 2021,” he said in a statement.   Between Jan and March this year, the revenue of Malaysia’s rubber exports jumped 169.6% to RM21.84 billion from RM8.1 billion made from the same period in 2020.  The downstream rubber products, which formed 89.5% of the total exports of the rubber industry with RM19.54 billion in value, also increased tremendously by 213.8%, driven by the strong increase in the latex goods sector.  Meanwhile, latex goods such as rubber gloves, latex threads and condoms recorded a total increase of 250.6% due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.   In the first quarter of 2021 (1Q21), latex goods accounted for 93.7% of total exports of rubber products while dry rubber products accounted for the remaining 6.3%.   The gloves sub-sector remained the largest export revenue generator for the rubber industry as it increased nearly four-fold or 265.7% to RM17.86 billion in the first three months of 2021.  For dry rubber, the sub-sector had bounced back to record double-digit growth of 22.1% to reach RM1.22 million in 2021 from RM1. billion, after recording a decline in the first quarter of last year due to the pandemic.  The dry rubber products sector includes tyres, industrial rubber goods, general rubber goods, and footwear.  Tyres, which is the largest exports within the dry rubber products sector, recorded RM431.5 million in 1Q21 with an increase of 24.6% compared to RM346.2 million last year.   Meanwhile, total exports of industrial rubber goods, which comprised of products for the automotive, mining and construction sectors, improved by 29.2% to RM306.3 million in 2021.  Commenting on the prospect of the domestic rubber industry, Nurul Islam said it needs to move up the global value chain while the rubber companies must explore ways for their products to be associated with bigger purposes of which will ultimately gain international recognition.  “Current initiatives are geared towards creating value for Malaysia’s rubber industry to ensure it remains resilient, agile, competitive and sustainable.  “The intended outcome is to elevate the industry up towards the global value chain in ensuring optimising potentials while enhancing the rubber industry to address bottlenecks and governance and reputational challenges,” he said.  He added that MRC will identify and nurture small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly from the dry rubber sector and assist them in exploring the international markets.   “There are four key areas which gear towards funding and grants, technical support, training and development as well as export marketing and branding that we are implementing and they would be tailored to the needs and potential of the selected companies,” he said.

Now they have switched the strategy to mass vaccination. This is good for gloves because surge in glove demand in the US - new pair for each dose of vaccination - New Norm for jabs.  Example is Malaysia - only when we started mass testing in Selangor is when you can see the true situation.  So the true situation of new cases are only true when all does mass testing.

So they prioritize vaccination whilst waiting for their glove orders to come. So now you all now that demand is so great and supply is just not enough.

NOT because supply cannot meet demand for FDA / Authority approved medical grade gloves. NOT because of its strong fundamentals.  Its all because of Share Price Manipulation, RSS, fear mongering, etc, etc to create Panic Selling. If you have holding power for medium term, best to hold.

My bet on Fumiko Hayashi :)  Google Translate from https://www.kanaloco.jp/news/government/electiondata/article-572486.ht...  Citizens' most important policy in the election of the mayor of Yokohama is ""corona measures"" Regarding the election of the mayor of Yokohama (announced on August 8th, vote counting on 22nd) due to the expiration of the term of office, 45.13% of Yokohama citizens place the highest priority on ""measures against the new coronavirus"" when voting on 10th and 11th. It was found in a civic intention survey jointly conducted by Kanagawa Shimbun and JX Press on both days.  This was followed by ""Attracting IRs (Integrated Resort Facilities including Casinos)"", followed by ""Welfare for the Elderly"" and ""Child-rearing Policy"", and many citizens expected the candidates to present policies to various municipal issues.  In the survey, three questions were asked about the policies to be emphasized when voting in the mayoral election. As a result, the most important ""policy"" was ""corona measures"" (45.13%), and the second was ""IR attraction"" (13.82%). The third and subsequent ones are ""welfare for the elderly"" (13.32%), ""child-rearing policy"" (7.26%), ""environmental measures"", ""disaster prevention"" (4.77%), and ""attracting companies"" (3.38%). ), ""Transportation network development"" (2.09%), and ""Tourism promotion"" (1.89%).  The highest percentage of ""corona countermeasures"" was emphasized by all generations, and it became clear that there were many requests for measures such as infection countermeasures and vaccination.  In addition, even when the response ratios of ""most important"" and ""second most important"" and ""third important"" are added, the number of citizens who attach importance to ""corona measures"" is the highest at 72.57%. It was revealed."

Last month bought back some when below rm5. I wont lose $ on TG when I already have locked in handsome profit last year. If ever TG below rm5 I will get out of TG with no win no lose for recent purchase. I have a TG plan lah... Im not greedy and I stay disciplined to my plan.    Posted by TGMaster > Jul 14, 2021 11:21 AM | Report Abuse X  @bullcock/Peaches/fellow good contributors,  Things were much better last year before this deluded old lady appeared. She is always the first to start insult, belittle, mock others. Even scold people prostitute and scold parents. She has no values, horrible upbringing, totally shameless. This forum was a 5 star resort casino last year, now degenerate into kampong gambling den within a few months. Even if someone bothers to inform i3 admin to remove her, she will reappear using a new ID. She has no life just keep posting dozens of thrash here everyday.  I notice people clicking ""Report Abuse"" next to the date/time of posts. I think the i3 system will auto delete posts with at least 10 people clicking ""Report Abuse"". So everyone just do your part to maintain order here and shut her up. Lets try if this method works....  There are almost no more glove promoters here, most ex-glovers sold off long ago already lah. She keeps yapping abt gloves more than genting here!   Posted by TGMaster > Jul 15, 2021 4:27 PM | Report Abuse X  I said below rm5 i will sell immediately. I sold immediately on Canada news.

To my credit, I have always predicted a crash or correction, it's just that my timing is hopeless.  I suggest you consider keeping your money in MY until the correction comes, you may even get a better exchange rate then - you could look up historical exchange rates with USA market dips."

If u are looking at long term like 2 to 3 yrs, i will just buy it staggered like 10% now, and it price goes up a bit like 8.20.. buya a bit more, but it if falls beloe 7.0, buy 20-30 % and start loading as it stays around any price bit by bit.. so if run up also u can money, run down also cab top up and when economy shoots up, u will be in front of most.  These people were holding maybank when it was rm9, and also when it was RM10. and most of us here avarage round 7.35-7.55 and some lucky ones at 6.99. If  u see MBB at 6.99 something , just sapu like 30%, and go somewhere and dont look at it for a year or two, then come back and see the price.   As a disclaimer, i am not a professional and i dont do any analysis but for my point of view. Any performan of MBB may not be how we expect it to perfom.

MAYBANK,bobvic96,554 posts,2021-07-09 14:13:00,"JJFinn Hello everyone, new in here. people tell me MBB is good dividend stock. Learn quite a bit from this forum in MBB.   Maybank is one of the best on Bursa.   Do a bit of research comparing different companies dividend and share price. Make sure the dividend is consistent and preferably going up.    Create a spreadsheet and calculate how many dividend cents you get per ringgit invested. I calculate the average and median dividends over, say, 5 years to give an idea of what you may get - those with more brains may do better statistical analysis.    Put your results in a table and sort on the dividend cents per ringgit. Obviously you may have to consider downturns, etc. such as Ambank's 1MDB fiasco (which really annoys me).  I also run a ""prediction"" over 5-10 years to see what the benefits of dividend reinvestment achieves - very simple as you have to make assumptions on share price and dividend.  One thing that stands out in this is that inflation of the share price is very detrimental to the returns unless dividend goes up accordingly.  You will see the lower you can average your share buying price the better the %age dividend returns.  The advantage of Maybank is it is 'blue chip' and long term you may get the benefit of a share price increase.  As everyone says, do your own research and this is not a buy or sell call."

MAYBANK,tollebunsmith,3229 posts,2021-07-09 09:11:00,"Learning from yesterdays's purchases, I learned NOT to trust major sellers selling off on fears, IF I think the price is right, just buy, cant go wrong much. And do not i have stated i would buy if around RM8 when the price was at 8.20++. SO it was a planned top up. ( Later if price goes below 7.80, dont blame me, but i will top up a bit more then, AND in AUG get the 20+ sen dividend.)"
MAYBANK,bobvic96,554 posts,2021-07-09 09:13:00,"tollebunsmith bobvic96 : Thanks.. Lose about 30% the moment they declare divvy.. but possible to sell before the dividend ex date.. so as NOT to pay the witholding tax?  I do not see what that would change from a tax point of view. I believe the only way to avoid US tax is if you live in a country with a dual tax agreement with them - you will still end up paying tax somewhere.  One interesting point on my gold shares, last month I received two dividends, the one I listed above and, from the same company a ""Return of capital"" dividend of USD 140.51 which was US tax free only Foreign Agent Fee of $1.45 and Nominee Fee of $1.34 deducted. I wasn't expecting this but a pleasant surprise.  PS, I may have sold 60% of my US stocks too early."

MAYBANK,tollebunsmith,3229 posts,2021-07-07 20:50:00,"Cslee1215  : divide ur cash into portion like 30-30-40. and start  buying bit by bit.. if u see a drop increase ur purchase value.. so  if price increase also u can see money.. if it drops.. then tambah  so u average out...  as they say dollar cost averaging.. UNLESS ur see a big drop like 5% foreign fund selling then grab a lot more.. this price 8.06 is good enough for me.. remember lots of people here who dont talk have bought at higher prices then us.. i use to buy maybank few years back.. and sold off when it went up moderately. Then when c19 in 2020 i 2 counters which went limit up and after a days i saw MBB at 7.60.. bought 30% and dropped to 7.25 then sapu 70%  an when it dropped to 6.99 no cash...  but ok laa  very happy and when it went to 8.25 on first div of that year .. i topped up with some cash which (fixed deposit).. it edged my average cost up.. but i had expected it to beyond RM9.50.   These are just my opinion on my strategy... not an advise to buy or sell,"
MAYBANK,tollebunsmith,3229 posts,2021-07-07 20:55:00,Hope that helps.... ur money ur decision. u are buying cheaper than me...  and another important point... the value u invest into a share if it a right mone will make u see a lot of profit without sleepless night.. just like when i pumped into SCIB .. but dare not sapu...   so enter with less than 30k.. total... didnt sell on a high and then didt feel right.. second round sapu at a higher price and av went up .. anyway sold all today and made a bit of money... It was just a small gamble.  but the fear of dirt inside the company ...  i dare not take a long position.

Just my view only. The people who lose are those who panic buiy and panic sell and IF buy goreng stock.

However, it will be on an opt-in model, unlike the 1st automatic loan deferment. Hence, we believe there is unlikely to have significant impact to banks and in any case, day 1 modification loss is a non-cash accounting entry & is gradually reversible in the future. Thus, we are treating it as an exceptional item. Overall, we expect negligible price reaction on the above development and price weakness is an opportunity to accumulate.

MAYBANK,tollebunsmith,3229 posts,2021-06-29 11:46:00,"HLIB’s VIEW Unlikely to have significant impact to banks, considering this is an opt-in model, which may deter non-affected borrowers to exploit this relief vs the 1st automatic loan moratorium. In our view, troubled borrowers would remain largely similar to before and thus, we do not expect to see a meaningful uptick in targeted assistance as a % of outstanding loan exposure. From our channel checks, the level of targeted repayment assistance take-up rate has stabilized over the past 1 quarter and is currently beneath 15%, better vs banks’ initial average guidance of 15-20%"

PBBANK,1invest1,526 posts,2021-06-28 18:20:00,"Anytime EPF is in, it is a challenge as it trades SUPER BIG BUY-SELL VOLUME & even a few cents can make money b'cos its cost is low. So, RETAILERS with very limited funds are LOSING OUT BIG TIME. The stk will then be sort of stuck or frozen as it rises very slowly.  PBB is a great company and deserves a much higher price as you can see how the bank operates in comparison with all the banks here. Perhaps, big funds are at work and what not, and in the end, it take a long time for PBB to see the light of day. PBB is transparent but is everything out there transparent ?  Your only option is to hold for a long time or switch to a more active stk with greater risks and volatility. Higher risks rewards you with higher returns if it works out.  Time is running out for many people, so you choose your objectives/goals corresponding with the risk-return ratio or probability.  At this juncture, most banks would not be going anywhere soon as a result of more moratoriums coming.  PBB will also be less affected as its client base is less affected by the economic downturn but the entire banking industry, economy, business environment and public sentiment is extremely weak. This will somehow affect PBB going forward in acquiring high volume quality loan applications from its various target segments.  Conclusion: Banking sector may be a laggard for this year and probably up to mid 2022 as it needs the economy to pick up."

Recall, back in late Mar-20 and early May-20, when BNM announced the automatic 6- mth loan moratorium and banks agreed to waive the additional hire purchase interest charge on borrowers (upon request by the MoF), on both occasions the KL Finance Index continued to trade sideways.   For large-sized banks, we like Maybank (TP: RM9.40) for its strong dividend yield offering, and Public Bank (TP: RM4.50) for its defensive qualities, over CIMB (TP: RM4.60). For mid -sized banks, RHB (TP: RM6.85) is favoured more than AMMB (TP: RM2.85) as the former has a higher CET1 ratio & also, larger FVOCI reserve to buffer against potential yield curve volatility."

The legendary billionaire investor has almost $50 billion of his $228 billion Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) invested in this one industry. The reason is simple: Bank stocks possess many of the Buffett must-haves. First, banks serve an important societal need that will never go away. Second, banking business models are relatively simple to understand. Third, despite the health of many banks improving dramatically since the 2008 financial crisis, some bank stocks are trading at a bargain -- a key indicator that now is the best time to invest.   if you focus on quality banks that have a strong history of managing risks and generating profits, banks can be excellent means of investing for the long term."

Adding new banks just by offering svcs thr digital format is not viable as trad'l banks with greater experience, financial reserves & branches are way ahead of these new SMALLER banks. In the US, you don't hear, read & see digital banks making great progress even with 320+ m ppl. So, in Msia, with 30+m (- 10 %), impact is minimal. Digital is to reach rural, but this is even worse, with lower income & POOR INTERNET ACCESS & CONNECTIVITY. Yo, recipe for disaster.

With this being the case, if we can break above the highs of the trading session on Monday, that should continue to put more pressure to the upside, perhaps opening up the possibility of a move towards the $1950 level. That is an area that has been significant resistance in the past and if we broke above there then we would almost certainly go much higher over the longer term."

FILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, May 12, 2021. REUTERS/Staff (Reuters) - European stocks headed lower on Wednesday, tracking weakness on Wall Street, as investors grew wary of rising inflationary pressures increasing the chances of an early tightening of monetary policy.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.1% by 0711 GMT, trading less than 2% below its all-time highs. Euro zone stocks felt the pressure as the euro touched a four-month high, making exports more expensive.  A jump in regulated electricity and gas bills and clothing and footwear prices saw British consumer price inflation more than double in April, data showed on Wednesday.  While central bank policymakers expect the surge to be temporary, investors are worried that the price rises may last for a prolonged period of time, pushing central banks to counter it with policy tightening.  Investors will be watching for more clues on policymakers' views on inflation when the U.S. Federal Reserve releases its minutes from the latest policy meeting.  A retreat in commodity prices made miners and oil and gas stocks among the top losers in Europe.

PBBANK,1invest1,526 posts,2021-05-15 23:49:00,"Agree with AllYouCanBuy PBB gives a lower dividend yield but higher share value appreciation. Dividend yield can only be up to a certain point - %.  Price appreciation can be much HIGHER - % depending on which stock. Price appreciation is superior to dividend in value and importance. No guarantees for both dividend and price appreciation. Furthermore, ownership between both banks are different. If your priority is on dividend, then MBB is superior. Many factors determine how, what, and why we choose PBB. It is our/my own money, and the choice is definitely PBB."

PBBANK,AllYouCanBuy,1890 posts,2021-05-15 17:23:00,@Fong Kh The yield depends on your cost. The lower the cost the higher the yield. Usually it is 3-4% per dividend payout.

VSTECS,gohkimhock,1940 posts,2021-05-24 14:26:00,"For 1Q2021, VSTECS registered revenue of RM669.0 million which was 79.5% above revenue of RM372.7 million achieved in the corresponding period of the preceding year (“1Q2020”). Profit after tax increased by 87.6% to RM12.7 million as compared to 1Q2020. All segments recorded higher revenue during the quarter. The ICT Distribution segment saw a 134.5% increase in revenue to RM423.1 million driven by the new normal of working from home and new handphone model launches. The Enterprise Systems segment posted revenue of RM227.6 million, an increase of 29.9% while the Group’s ICT Services segment grew by 7.7% to RM18.3 million.  Chief Executive Officer of VSTECS, Mr. Soong Jan Hsung said: “The first quarter of the year is typically a less vibrant period for ICT spending, but our performance this year bucked the trend as digital spending continues to accelerate amid lockdowns. With the current shift towards working and learning from home coupled with the extended personal income tax relief of RM2,500 on computer products until the end of 2021, market demand for mobile phone, tablet and notebook PC is expected to remain robust in 2021."

VSTECS,SharinganInsights,6 posts,2021-02-16 08:55:00,"VSTECS: Moving to The Cloud   Trading Buy with FV of RM3.60 (27% upside). Enterprise segment (2x higher GPM than ICT distr.) will be a key earnings driver as corporations scramble to upgrade critical back-end infra to (i) tighten network security, (ii) support workforce mobility and (iii) quicken data processing speed. This leads to massive increase in web traffic and a surge in demand for cloud/data center software and hardware. As such, VSTECS even expanded its portfolio offering with ~5 new enterprise brands in 2020 and is in talks to bring in Alibaba Cloud which could serve as another share price catalyst.  Lead time for laptop/tablet doubled due to immense demand from the WFH trend and is expected to remain elevated following the PERMAI (tax relief on laptop purchase) and CERDIK (free laptop for 150k students) initiatives.  As a potential beneficiary of the RM1.16b NIIS project by IRIS (customer), VSTECS’s current fwd PE of 12.5x serves as a laggard play to the tech sector’s monster rally. Our Trading Buy with FV of RM3.60 is based on FY21E PER of 16x.  (By Kenanga)"

VSTECS,Kensington,138 posts,2020-08-15 18:32:00,"My opinion is that the 2QR result is commendable considering the shutdown of sales and services in the entire month of April during MCO. It was only on 4 May onward that the business picked up fast during the Conditional MCO. I hope the next quarter will show some improvement going forward. However, there might be some uncertainties in the final quarter as the unemployment figures will be out and the moratorium on the bank loan over by 30 September. The business model I think is suited to a post pandemic new normal i.e. WFH."

Besides, VSTECS rebound back up to RM2.12 during today's morning session which again proved this support line is strong.

VSTECS,Mikecyc,25020 posts,2020-05-31 23:10:00,China Press   * 2020年5月21日 （吉隆坡21日讯）马股近期散户涌现、炒风骤起，更有居心叵测者透过社交软体接触本地投资者，诱引他们投资海外股市。但业界资深专家提醒，这类投资手法风险极高，加上投资者不了解海外金融市场情况，稍有不慎恐随时被套牢。  首邦股票行资深股票经纪吴继宗回应《中国报》询问时说，此类操作事实上存在已久，且手法大同小异。 “典型的手法就是一些自称投资专家或私募集团的人士，透过Whatsapp等群组提供内幕消息或免费课程。”  先给甜头再要求分账 吴继宗说，这些“专家”通常会让投资者尝到一两次甜头，并在投资者往后获利时要求五五分账。为了继续获得内幕消息，投资者一般上都会照做。  除了股市，近年也有不少不法分子通过个人对个人（P2P）融资、传销项目等骗取投资者的金钱。因此，业者呼吁，投资者在决定参与任何融资或投资计划前，最好亲自在国内监管机构查证有关项目的真实性，以防被骗。

VSTECS,calvintaneng,41203 posts,2020-04-02 17:54:00,"See this  The rush to work from home as COVID-19 grips Europe has led to bumper sales of related tech for distributors, official stats confirm.  The UK government has followed policies enacted in Italy, Spain and France by locking down citizens to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, while remote working in other regions of the continent has picked up speed.  Context, which tracks shipment data for the region, logged a marked rise in demand for certain kit including PCs and audio-visual (AV) hardware for the eight weeks to 15 March compared to the same time frame a year earlier.  Among the biggest sellers in Europe were headsets, headphones and microphones useful for people jumping onto conferences calls – growing 57 per cent year-on-year.  In some countries, demand for AV systems sent shipments soaring by triple digits, with unit sales in Italy – which has seen the highest number of deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus – up 292 per cent. Sales in Portugal went up 252 per cent, 163 per cent in Finland, 144 per cent in Austria, 135 per cent in Switzerland, and 125 per cent in Germany.  In the smart home subsets of smart security, access control and assisted living, sales bounced 85 per cent across Europe, with France and Spain reporting the biggest lifts.  Notebooks are obviously in high demand, as our article revealed weeks ago, but according to Context data, desktop computers have also seen a decent rise in sales via distributors in the eight-week period, growing 22 per cent, with desktop workstations rising 16 per cent.  ""IT channel businesses have met a growing demand for products enabling home and remote working as employees were put on lockdown across much of Europe over the past two months,"" said Howard Davies, Context CEO.  ""We can see how quickly the situation is changing in each country.""  Other areas doing well in the current climate include telephony and conference systems, up 17 per cent in Europe, as UPS climbed 15 per cent and solid-state drives grew 15 per cent. ® https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/kianweiaritcles/2020-04-02-story-h14...   https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/02/european_coronavirus_tech_buy...

KUALA LUMPUR (July 14): Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) is reported to have made the largest strides in renewable energy (RE) among Malaysian electricity producers on the back of the government-controlled TNB’s aggressive green ambitions, according to TA Securities Holdings Bhd today.  In a report today, TA Securities analyst Kylie Chan Sze Zan wrote that time is, nevertheless, on the side of fossil-fuel-based power producers, as it is still early days for RE proliferation.   ""Therefore, we opine that TNB’s proactive RE goals and swift execution to-date are commendable,” Chan said.    Malaysian power producers include Malakoff Corp Bhd and YTL Power International Bhd.  Chan said Malakoff has also kickstarted efforts to diversify into RE via various smallish projects.   On YTL Power, she said TA Securities believes ""the group needs to ramp up efforts by finally venturing into the RE space”.  ""We maintain 'overweight' on the power & utilities (P&U) sector as P&U companies remain attractive before and after the Covid-19 pandemic,” Chan said.  She said the P&U sector’s fixed earnings offer refuge from lingering Covid-19-related headwinds.  ""As such, this all-weather play offers both peace-of-mind and earnings growth,” she said.  Chan said TA Securities has ""buy"" calls on TNB, Malakoff and YTL Power shares.  According to her, TA Securities' target price (TP) for TNB stood at RM11.50 while TPs for Malakoff and YTL Power were 97 sen and 85 sen respectively.  At Bursa Malaysia's 12:30pm break today, TNB’s share price settled up one sen or 0.1% at RM9.67 while Malakoff rose 0.5 sen or 0.61% to 82 sen.  YTL Power’s share price settled unchanged at 69 sen."

TENAGA,TreeTopView,386 posts,2021-07-17 08:52:00,"Paul, the risks of short dated warrants in this current market environment are greatly magnified, no matter how the individual company's prospects look.  There is no point swimming against the tide, as in most cases the investor will get washed away. If you believe in the long term prospects of a company then perhaps take advantage of weakened prices to build up an investment portfolio of quality stocks. Less margins but generally a safer bet. Consider warrants in a far more buoyant market.  Just my thoughts :)"

CESSB is a joint-venture (JV) between Tenaga Nasional Bhd's (TNB) wholly-owned subsidiary, TNB Engineering Corporation Sdn Bhd (TNEC), and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd's (MAHB) 100 per cent-owned subsidiary, Airport Ventures Sdn Bhd.  In a statement today, TNB said under the 20-year Concession Agreement signed by both parties, CESSB will operate, maintain, and upgrade the existing district cooling cogeneration plant, one of Malaysia’s largest district cooling plants in Malaysia.  ""The JV company will also sell, distribute, and supply cooling energy and electricity to customers in KLIA and surrounding facilities using reliable, modern and efficient technology,"" it said.  CESSB will modernise the gas-powered facility to fully electric, resulting in the KLIA plant producing cooling energy with higher efficiency, thus significantly reducing KLIA's operating costs by over RM50 million per annum.   TNEC chairman Lim Fu Yen said the collaboration between TNB and MAHB via CESSB accentuates TNB’s aspiration to be the leading provider of sustainable energy solutions in Malaysia and internationally.  ""We are confident that this collaboration will significantly and positively contribute to the great customer experience that all KLIA passengers can enjoy,” he added.  TNEC is a specialist in sustainable energy system engineering, and a market leader in the business of development, operation, and maintenance of district cooling systems and large-scale solar plants with a proven track record in Malaysia and abroad.  Apart from operating and maintaining six district cooling plants in Malaysia, the company has also completed the development of a few other local district cooling plants, two district cooling plants in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, and three large-scale solar plants in Malaysia. - Bernama       BUYING TENAGA FOR its: 1) the biggest utilities giant supplying electricity in the county 2) the company is getting more and more into renewable energy play. 3) would be the largest renewable energy player in Malaysia. 4) good and growing dividend pay (excluding the dividend given during pandemic period) 5) stable blue chip stock that is resillende. 6) invested heavily in the renewable energy sector in other country such as the UK (solar & wind), Turkey ( gas, wind, hydro), Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Pakistan and India (coal, gas & solar plants)."

With the overall market being weak (understatement) then the opportunities for them to lower the prices of stocks is fairly straight forward and there is nothing the retailers can do about that.  What the long term retailer investor CAN do is join in and take advantage of the lower prices for future gains.  You can either choose to join into the blue chip game or move on and play the mid cap and lower market stocks. One thing is for sure, you will never beat the fund managers but you can join them to buy and hold for dividends and capital gains."

TENAGA,Tedinvestor,704 posts,2021-06-28 19:48:00,Rebate  are cover by government. Just like previously
TENAGA,WenJun,495 posts,2021-06-28 20:09:00,"Tenaga Nasional Berhad (“TNB”) wishes to inform that the Government of Malaysia (“Government”) has approved the continued implementation of Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (“ICPT”) mechanism for the period of 1 July until 31 December 2021.  For this period of ICPT implementation, the Government has decided to maintain an ICPT rebate of 2.00 sen/kWh for all customers including domestic customers with monthly consumption of 300 kWh and below. This ICPT rebate is partly the result of overall reduction in actual generation costs for the period of January to June 2021.    Details of the actual fuel prices for period January to June 2021 are as follows:  i.   A slight increase of average coal price in the global market at USD70.06/MT, as compared to the benchmark coal price set in the base tariff at USD67.45/MT.  ii.  Starting from January 2020, the gas price is set based on Reference Market Price (“RMP”), replacing the former two-tier gas pricing mechanism which comprises of Regulated Gas Price and LNG Price. For period January to June 2021, the average RMP price is RM17.16/mmBTU which is lower than the benchmark gas price for the year set in the base tariff at RM27.20/mmBTU.  Any shortfall or excess in the ICPT will be funded or transferred to customers via the Kumpulan Wang Industri Elektrik (“KWIE”) fund to aid in the stabilisation of electricity tariff in the future via gradual build-up of the fund. TNB also wishes to inform that the impact of ICPT implementation is neutral on TNB and will not have any effect to its business operations and financial position.  Please refer to ST’s website (http://www.st.gov.my/) for further details on the ICPT implementation. Electricity customers also have the ability to estimate future ICPT impact using the ICPT Calculator available at www.myelectricitybill.my.  This announcement is dated 28 June 2021."

TENAGA,tobiasthestocker,7 posts,2021-06-21 12:20:00,"as said last friday, tenaga go back down because of quadraple witching day. Whatever went up will normally go back down the next day(i.e Tenaga), whatever went down normally will go back up the next day(i.e. Airport). Porfolio rebalancing would suffle our stock market and bring effect into it no matter up or down so dont be surprised to see market reacts to it.  Not sure what is the motive behind those who said Tenaga will fly. Also, normal retailers cant perform RSS or IDSS, even if we know will drop lol. The importance of knowledge before trading and investing are crucial, hope no one were deceived or trapped by those who create false statements."
TENAGA,tobiasthestocker,7 posts,2021-06-21 12:29:00,"i would say rm10 is currently a psychological resistance turned support for tenaga. If it breaks below again, the actual crucial support would be RM9.84, which is very near only."
TENAGA,jeffchan1901,587 posts,2021-06-21 12:50:00,"@tobiasthestocker   Airport jump on news of MAHB proposal to govt on revitalising Subang airport. missed my chance to add a bit for this stock.   For Tenaga, the pressure started to push upwards for the past 1-2 weeks. the price could not break through due to sellers need to take profit at first chance due to funds stuck at the below 10.00 price point for some time. the reason why it is very difficult to go up is bcos of absence of foreign investment in Tenaga, without which the strong push the price cannot go up as retail investors have limited funds and profit taking also occurs.   Everyone knows that Tenaga is undervalued and good for dividend (otherwise you and me wont be here in the first place right?). But last Friday beside the QWD could also be the start of foreign funds starting to buy this stock back - see article above.   This is possibly due also in part to Tenaga seriousness in addressing the ESG issues of late, e.g. investments in renewable energy in Vietnam and Singapore and also the commitment to cut down on coal usage and limit to 30% in the medium term. EPF sold bcos of i-Sinar draw down of course which will end in June 30. We should see some uplift in the coming weeks for sure. Remember that EPF holds Tenaga for our EPF annual dividends, and they aint gonna change their position anytime soon unless Tenaga changes and reduce their dividend pay out policy."

The MoU, among others, will focus on making deliveries more environmentally friendly with the introduction of electric vehicles (EV) in DHL's fleet, marking a new milestone in DHL's commitment to zero emissions logistics by 2050.  The MoU further includes cooperation in zero carbon and cost reduction initiatives, encompassing the implementation of energy-efficient equipment, building energy management systems, and rooftop solar panels. DHL is currently assessing TNB's current electricity supply chain and identifying opportunities for enhancement.  ""This collaboration leverages on TNB's collective expertise in energy management, energy audit, and sustainable energy solutions towards a more sustainable future for the nation,"" said TNB President and Chief Executive Officer Datuk Ir. Baharin Din.  ""As DHL grows its fleet of electric vehicles in the coming years, TNB aims to gradually build more EV charging stations at DHL's facilities and their delivery routes.""  With TNB taking the lead with the installation of EV charging infrastructure on-site and at strategic locations along service routes, DHL Express will roll out the first batch of EV vans at its Kuala Lumpur service centre by early next year.  S.A. 2021/06/90 (HQ)  Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, said: ""As the world's leading express service provider, DHL Express is committed to its role in setting the standards for climate protection in the industry. The deployment of electric vehicles within our fleet represents one of several steps we are taking to reduce our environmental footprint and drive our operations towards decarbonisation.""  ""In Malaysia, we also provide additional carbon reporting services that allow customers to analyse their environmental footprint and manage their carbon emissions. Customers can also receive verified calculation and offsetting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for our transport and logistics services through climate protection projects. Through collective efforts with partners like TNB, we can achieve long-term sustainable value for the communities we serve and meet our Group-wide goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.""  Baharin added that with the MoU, TNB supports DHL's sustainability goal via its subsidiaries, namely GSPARX Sdn. Bhd., which provides rooftop solar panel systems for green energy solutions; Maevi Sdn. Bhd. for building energy management solutions; and TNB Energy Services Sdn. Bhd. (TNBES) for energy audits.  ""TNB is committed to supporting DHL's growth through this partnership, which aligns with our aspiration to be a leading provider of sustainable energy solutions in Malaysia and internationally. As a primary driver of the nation's energy transition, this initiative also builds on our effort to lead the development of a conducive ecosystem for wider EV adoption in Malaysia,"" added Baharin.  On the generation side, TNB is strengthening its position in the domain of sustainable energy sources by adopting emerging RE technologies of solar, wind, biomass and biogas which accounts for 713.2 MW of generation. TNB is targeting to increase its renewable energy (RE) capacity to 8,300MW by 2025, driven by domestic and international initiatives. As of March 2021, TNB's RE capacity stands at 3,402MW, of which 2,736MW is within Malaysia and 666MW from international.  The MoU comes as part of DHL's measures to strengthen its portfolio dedicated to EV logistics and in line with Deutsche Post DHL Group's increased pace to decarbonise the company. To this end, the Group is investing a total of EUR7 billion over the next ten years in reducing its CO2 emissions, which includes the expansion of its e-vehicle fleet.  Julian Neo and TNB Chief Retail Officer, Datuk Ir. Megat Jalaluddin Megat Hassan, signed the MoU, and it takes effect from 10 June 2021 for the next 12 months.     hold tight2.....malaysia version of tesla soon. tp rm15 in 2023"

TENAGA,jeffchan1901,587 posts,2021-06-19 20:30:00,"@i3gambler very risky going all-in on C85.   Heard of the 'every third Friday of every quarter' theory? If the theory is true, just be careful of a very sharp correction come Monday. The huge movement is obviously not done by small retailers. big boyz at play - although I am surprise not reported in the announcement. big boyz with all that financial muscle and financial experience and savy, the risk and possibility of a snafu is very unlikely if any.

To quote your statement:  "" The value of TENAGA jump up 100%, and yet someone still wanted to sell TENAGA-C85 at RM0.05?  Trade call warrant without looking at the mother share?  Can not do like that lah.""  How sure are we that the big players didn't look at call warrant? oh wait.. maybe they did and that's why they didn't buy in to it but hope that someone will hook line and sinker to pick it up.   A wise poker player once said, if we can't spot the fool sitting in the table, that's because we are most likely that fool.  I could be wrong but after reading that theory and your article on the C85 more or less reaffirms my suspicion. good luck bro, hope I am wrong.

On such days, traders with large positions in these contracts may be financially incentivized to try to temporarily push the underlying market in a certain direction to affect the value of their contracts. The expiration forces traders to act by a certain day, causing trading volume in affected markets to rise.  Triple or quadruple witching is often said to cause volatility in the underlying markets, and in the expiring contracts themselves, both during the week preceding, and on the expiration day. """

TENAGA,i3gambler,499 posts,2021-06-20 10:24:00,"jeffchan1901  As I said, I bought 300K units C85 on Friday at 0.05,  Let say tomorrow the mother share give back 30 cents (75% of 40 cents last minute jump on Friday) and trade at 10.14,  The intrinsic value of C85 = (10.14 - 9.6337) / 6.7436 = RM0.075, Still a good 50% margin from 0.05.  The other thing is on the issue of settlement calculation. The issuer announced that as at 31.05.2021, There were only 14,444,900 unit outstanding C85 in the market, As the conversion ratio of 6.7436, meaning 14,444,900 / 6.7436 = 2,142,106 mother share.  Now, the settlement calculation is based on 5 trading days data, In this case, it will be from 23rd, 24th, 25th, 28th and 29th of June. Further more, it is not from the closing price, but it is VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)"
TENAGA,getingreal,189 posts,2021-06-20 11:37:00,"i3gambler, I have been looking at your numbers, very interesting. 300K units at 0.05 will have cost you 15K + brokerage and stamp.  On paper you have a margin of 0.025c if the price holds as set out. However you would still have to convert the the 300K units at a huge cost which my guess is you are not planning to do to get that margin. If you hold and don't convert the 15k is burned so my guess is you must sell.  If I'm correct and you don't intend to convert, then you along with many many many others will be more and more keen to sell as the pay up day gets closer.  I have a feeling the 2.5c margin may well evaporate if the mother share price does not stay up, or better yet get up near 12.00 target then you will make great money on your investment.  Two sides to the your coin your gambling, up to a complete loss on one side, or a great profit on the other.  I think its not a game for investors, its a game for gamblers. I wish you luck."
TENAGA,i3gambler,499 posts,2021-06-20 12:03:00,"getingreal  No need for us to come up with any conversion money. I copy and paste the following from the official document which we can download and read.   Settlement: Cash settlement only  The Call Warrants give the Holder the right to receive from us within 7 Market Days from the Expiry Date  In the event that the Cash Settlement Amount is equal to or less than zero on the Expiry Date, the Call Warrants shall terminate on the Expiry Date and cease to be valid and our obligations in respect of the Call Warrants shall terminate absolutely.  Closing Price: The VWAP of TENAGA Shares (subject to any adjustment as may be necessary to reflect any capitalisation, rights issue, distribution or others) for the 5 Market Days prior to and including the Market Day immediately before the Expiry Date (subject to the market disruption event provision below)."
TENAGA,getingreal,189 posts,2021-06-20 13:25:00,"Yes, if the price is equal to, or less, than the average share price for 5 days before the strike date then if you still hold them then unit is automatically cancelled and your investment in them is burned.  If however the price of the mother shares is above the strike price, and assuming you have not already sold, then you have to either come out with huge cash to buy at the strike price or burn your paper your choice on that date. If you come out with the cash (bank draft) and buy coz the price is attractive you will have to hold for a while until the shares are actually issued to you, maybe a week to 21 days and you cannot sell them until they are in your name."
TENAGA,i3gambler,499 posts,2021-06-20 13:45:00,"getingreal,  No burn, and no need to come out with the conversion money, it is automatically cash settled.  For example,  If the VWAP of TENAGA for the 5 trading days is 10.14, Then, (10.14 - 9.6337) / 6.7436 = RM0.075, The issuer, in this case CIMB Investment Bank will pay yus RM0.075 per unit.  I used to receive cheque from the issuers, but I heard that now they just bank-in to our account just like our dividend.  Many years ago, there were some call warrants that were physical settlement, that one we need to send them the money and they will give you the mother shares.  But in recent years, I never came across any call warrant that is for physical settlement.  However, it is still safer to read the official document which you can download from bursamalaysia.com  For this particular C85, I have read the document, it is automatically cash settlement, we just have to wait for the money if the mother share is higher than the conversion price / strike."

TENAGA,milosh,332 posts,2021-06-20 15:18:00,"i3gambler is right with no conversion, but the settlement price will be based on the last 5 trading days only, here I was wrong with the close price - but it means it is even harder to manipulate. its also true it is a good entry for 0.05 *IF* the market price will stay elevated. Too risky for me."
TENAGA,i3gambler,499 posts,2021-06-20 15:36:00,"milosh,  As of today, I think I was lucky to have bought C85 at 0.05, My break even = 9.6337 +  6.7436 * 0.05 = 9.971 Meaning if TENAGA's VWAP > 9.971, I will make gross profit.  Of course if the VWAP is <9.6337, then all my C85 will be total loss."
TENAGA,milosh,332 posts,2021-06-20 16:03:00,"i don't think it will be loss, but the price was around 10 for a long time, there is some risk it will get back again just below 10 before expire, but yes 0.05 entry has a good odds"

GSPARX, a leading entity in providing rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panel solutions to retail customers in Malaysia, clinched the Best Brand in Rooftop Solar Solutions in Powering Green Energy award at a ceremony held in Kuala Lumpur.  Allo, a key player in the development of high-speed broadband (HSBB) infrastructure to support the government’s Jalinan Digital Negara (Jendela) plan, won the Best Brand in Telco Broadband Infrastructure Services.

The national electricity corporation is the only brand accorded this recognition under the energy-power awards category for Malaysia. It won similar awards in 2014, 2018 and 2019.   More than 400 brands from over 45 countries were named “Brand of the Year” in the 2020-2021 World Branding Awards.  The World Branding Awards is the premier awards programme of the World Branding Forum, a global non-profit organisation based in London. The Awards recognise the innovative and creative ways the successful brands have managed to remain distinct and relevant to their consumers over the past year.  Winners were judged through three streams comprising brand valuation (30%), consumer market research (40%) and public online voting (30%). The voting and nomination had taken place amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic whilst many countries were faced with restriction measures that had greatly disrupted the economic landscape."

It appears they need more than 2 months of  MCO and more factory expected to close thier operations due not economical to continue with thier operations.  Any lock down more than 1 month is disaster for TNB. But now, they want to close more than 2 months probably 3 months.. That is  catastrophe.  Now I need to plan for cut loss this weak."

People in cars or schools or out and about are consuming no electricity. Even driving to and from work your not consuming any electricity for 2 to 3 hours a day.  You watch as house bills creep up several levels on their rate per Kwhr billings."

Another gem from you......""

Well, that is factually correct, people are asking for discounts to their accounts...BUT....you are clearly not aware that those discounts in the recent past have been paid by government relief schemes, NOT directly from the Tenaga bottom line.  I'm not too sure whether you have an agenda or are either naive or perhaps a bit simple, but you do need to have a good hard look at yourself. I'd suggest you read ALL the posts YOU have posted on this thread, and there are many, to see if there is any actual sense to your posts, then try and work out whether you may need some professional assistance, be that medically or financially."

TENAGA,roger3210,473 posts,2021-06-04 01:23:00,ANEKA（0226）业绩分享 以去年上市的公司来说，鲜少有公司至今依然处于低于 IPO 的价位 – 而今天分享的 ANEKA 以目前来说，对比其 IPO 价格的 RM 0.330 一股还低；那今天的分享将会讲述 ANEKA 的业绩、公司的前景以及公司的估值。不过由于公司并无按年可比较的数据，因此将主要对比 FY 2021 Q1 为准。  • ANEKA 在该季度（“FY 2021 Q2”）的营业额为 RM 29.3 Million，对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 32.1 Million 下跌了 8.63%；而以目前来说，公司有约 RM 27.0 Million 或 92.00% 的营业额来自于马来西亚的业务，剩余的 8.00% 则是来自于印尼方面的业务。  • 管理层在季报内有提到，公司因为 MCO 2.0 而导致工程被拖缓；不过据我所知，公司在 MCO 后打桩机的使用率偏高，甚至于需要租借同行的机械来进行工程 – 反映出公司的业务已经持续出现了好转。  • 虽然公司并无提及他们的订单，但公司在近期内持续获得多个建筑项目的订单；如公司获得 Nakano Construction Sdn. Bhd.（“NCSB”）价值 RM 28.9 Million 的订单、同时也获得了 Gaya Kuasa Sdn. Bhd.（“GKSB”）价值 RM 16.4 Million 的订单以及最近其公司获得 IJM Construction Sdn. Bhd.（“ICSB”）价值 RM 77.8 Million 的订单，合计为 RM 123.1 Million，这除了反映出 ANEKA 的订单状况良好之外，也显示出建筑领域 – 尤其是私人领域依然在持续发展中。  • 另外，公司在 Note A9 内虽然提及公司分别有建筑业务（“Construction”）以及设备租凭（“Rental Equipment”）的业务；不过为了避免读者亲自阅读季报会混淆，直接参考建筑业务就行，基本上租凭的业务是公司属于自己的业务，在最后会被回扣出来。  • 以毛利而言，公司在该季度的毛利为 RM 4.8 Million，对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 5.2 Million 下滑了 7.25%；管理层提及该季度的业绩下滑主要是因为营业额下滑，不过毛利率在该季度也从 16.14% 提升到该季度的 16.39%。  • 以净利而言，公司在该季度的净利为 RM 1.4 Million，对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 0.5 Million 亏损则是改善了 399.14%；这主要是因为在 FY 2021 Q1 公司有一次性的 RM 2.2 Million IPO 费用导致亏损加剧 – 接下来公司并不会再被 IPO 费用影响。  • 提及 IPO 集资的资本来说，ANEKA 在近期也做出了非常有趣的举动；即公司原本将购置一台钻孔直径为 2.5 米、钻孔深度为 87.0 米的钻孔机械更换为暂钻孔直径 3.7 米、钻孔深度为 100.0 米的机械，另外也将原本打算偿还银行贷款的资金用在购置该钻孔上 – 以个人对于公司的了解，若非业务良好，公司鲜少会将偿还贷款的数额用在购置机械上，配合上述公司获得的合约，很难不想象公司接下来的业绩会持续改善。  • 以净经营现金流而言，公司在该季度的净经营现金收入为 RM 3.1 Million，而对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 2.6 Million 净流出来说改善了许多；不过客观而言，建筑领域的现金流并不稳定，因此最好还是等待整个财政年完成再做出对于现金流的评估。  • 以公司的现金而言，目前 ANEKA 剔除在银行高达 RM 8.7 Million 的定存以及 RM 2.8 Million 的银行透支，实际流动现金为 RM 12.4 Million；虽然债务高达 RM 27.3 Million，但绝大部分都是贸易用的贷款，通常都为短期，因此短期内，公司应暂无现金流方面的问题。  • 目前 ANEKA 也依然并未公布派发任何股息。  以 ANEKA 这家公司来说，公司对比起其他的建筑领域的公司确实缺少曝光率。不过我们看到公司最坏情况已经过去，业务也随着公司获得众多合约有望持续改善。不过要回到公司巅峰的表现依然需要一段时间 – 而目前公司的估值为 52.12 倍的 P/E，若是以每个季度 RM 1.5 Million 的净利来计算的话，折合净利为一年 RM 6.0 Million；根据这样的计算方式而言 ANEKA 的未来 P/E 估值大约为 26.83 倍。  而有趣的是，公司的同行 ECONBHD（5253）目前依然是负 P/E 估值，而 PTARAS（9598）则是较为合理，目前在 12.25 倍。但已过去打桩领域来说，普遍比一般的建筑公司高出 2 倍左右的估值（ECONBHD 以及 PTARAS 的 5 年平均值分别为 32.10 倍以及 21.10 倍），因此 ANEKA 如果持续获得新的合约，继续成长下去的话，则是非常不错的。配合目前市场因为疫情而恐慌，ANEKA 的股价也并无太大的波动，或许大家可以开始关注这家比较被市场冷落的建筑公司。

Tenaga charging thier industrial/high voltage commercial customers based on  maximum demand per month and not based on consumption like normal consumer. Means, if the factory highest consumption   is RM500,000  per day and the lowest consumption is RM10,000 per day, the company still need to pay 30 days x RM500,000 of that billing cycle.  In addition to that, more workers expected to work from home. Hence, consumption by consumers expected to be high since they need to switch on aircon and etc."

TENAGA,iHunter,613 posts,2021-04-28 09:58:00,Hopefully we can get some up to at RM10.1. We need to trigger the smart money to change their mode to super accumulation mode which I know EPF traders are on monitoring mode.
TENAGA,iHunter,613 posts,2021-04-28 10:20:00,The amount is not enough... We need to bring down the price so that all the weak holders can clear their holding. It seems  we need  bring down the price to RM9.5 ++. We will start to bring down the price after lunch.

The smart money  can  bring down the price this morning  and then they can also  bring-up the price. After lunch, they  will try to bring down the price again.   The smart money now see this counter as stock with many negative news particular longer MCO expected after Raya. So, heading to RM9.5 is possible but not today."

TENAGA,Donator,664 posts,2021-04-28 11:56:00,is time to collect more...buy some 1st if drop then buy again...
TENAGA,Pinky,1613 posts,2021-04-28 11:56:00,@Titan I know what I wrote la  Understand that there is difference between EARNINGS and EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION.  Earnings = Profit which included a lot of accounting adjustments and paper profits/(losses)  Distributable earnings = usually recurring cash incomes which the company has no immediate use for which will/can be fully paid out as dividends
TENAGA,Pinky,1613 posts,2021-04-28 11:59:00,"Example:  Profit After Tax 100 million  But that 100 million was derived after deducting depreciation, tax charges, amortisation expenses, FRS 9 adjustments, foreign currency translation losses/(incomes) etc etc etc  Actual incomes in cash could be 110 million, 120 million or even 150 million.  So it can be perfectly acceptable for the company to pay more than 100 million as dividends."
TENAGA,Pinky,1613 posts,2021-04-28 13:40:00,"Just did a calculation.  Taking past 3 years earnings, assuming 75% payout, you can get easily 50+ sen dividends  So that's min 5.0% dividend yield, if no special payouts"

INARI,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-07-11 00:41:00,马股下半年拨云见日 4大投资主题值得关注 2021年07月10日 下半年投资策略 （吉隆坡9日讯）尽管当前乌云密布，但随着本地疫苗接种加速，分析员认为，马股市场应会在下半年恢复元气，并点名股息、科技、商品和复苏主题的投资策略。  大华继显研究分析员在今日发布报告指出，群体免疫的乐观情绪，相信能消除政局不稳的忧虑；昨日富时隆综指挫跌1.4%，因为巫统宣布撤销对国盟的支持，引发投资者担忧。  “不过，我们认为市场在很大程度上，已消化了政治风险。更重要的是，未来潜在新政府采取的政策方向，也不太可能与国盟当前方针有太大偏差。”  因此，随着我国疫苗接种加速，焦点会重新转向经济重开的主题，分析员估计市场将从第三季中期开始复苏。  虽然马股市场复苏不均衡，但预计末季仍会持续复苏，归功于广泛市场赢家所引领。  “在末季达到群体免疫的目标，将令我国在明年可重开边境。”  同时，分析员列出年底综指1635点目标，等同本益比16.2倍，符合历史均值。  分析员还列出了下半年重要正面事件，包括本地封锁松绑，希望可在第三季底开放跨州、云顶（GENTING，3182，主板消费股）户外主题公园开张、特定种植股和商品股迎来异常强劲盈利季度，及年底实现群体免疫。  不过，关键风险则是下月单日卖空禁令将解除，及手套均价进一步潜在走低。  大华继显研究选股 综指明年底料冲1775点  放眼明年，当我国经济重开，并顺利展开复苏的前提下，分析员估计综指有显著上行空间。  “假设盈利增长1到2%，且估值恢复到疫前的16.9倍水平，综指明年底有望触及1775点。”  投资主题选股 近期催化剂不清晰  配合上述展望，分析员列出了4大投资主题，包括价值和高股息投资、科技股（受惠于需求增长、贸易转移及全球5G科技推出）、经济重开，及特定商品超级周期主题。  因此，分析员建议增持有价值的银行股、高股息的产托股、复苏主题的博彩股等、电子与制造业的特定出口股，及商品为主的特定提炼和种植股。  报告补充，分析员大型股首选为联昌国际（CIMB，1023，主板金融股）、云顶大马（GENM，4715，主板消费股）、益纳利美昌（INARI，0166 ，主板科技股）和MyEG（MYEG，0138，主板科技股）。  同时，还有齐力（PMETAL，8869，主板工业股）、双威（SUNWAY，5211，主板工业股）、马电讯（TM，4863，主板电信与媒体股）和云升控股（YINSON，7293，主板能源股）。  中型股首选合成种植（HSPLANT，5138，主板种植股）和腾达科技（PENTA，7160，主板科技股）；环境、社会与监管（ESG）股项首选为亚通、联昌国际、益纳利美昌、MyEG、双威和云升控股。  “不过，在近期市场催化剂不清晰之际，即冠病确诊病例高居不下，投资者最初只会青睐价值/股息和科技增长股。”  手套建筑料跑输大市  至于手套和建筑股，分析员相信下半年仍会跑输大市；这两大股项在今年上半年已显著跑输综指。  “在需求放缓和全球供应强劲增长情况下，手套商应该仍会因均价下跌而表现逊色。”  建筑股方面，虽然受益于房产销售显著恢复，但大型项目加速推进的希望渺茫，将令本就承受打击的建筑股表现不佳。

It hold more than 16% of Inari thats is equivalent to 800 shares of Inari for every 1000 insas u hold . 5. Insas has a net cash exceeding Rm 560m or 80 sen cash per share. 6. Insas has shown very strong earnings growth. 7. Insas benefited from very strong presence in the technology 5G area plus the financial sector of stockbroking, investment banking & lending and advisory area. 8. Insas is the taiko in the leap mkt & ace mkt listing under M&A Investment banking Group. 9.

INARI,steadylahbro,89 posts,2021-05-26 20:06:00,"Should be roughly 334.5 mil new shares issued via pp as it is 10% of issued ordinary shares.

Long run, the pp would be a positive thing, in the short run.... It may scare away some buyers but you gotta do what you gotta do I suppose :P"

The management can play around with workers' shift to fit the 60 % capacity requirement .Depending on how the factory usual night shift capacity, ''some''  factories (not all k) night shift won't be 100% capacity as compared to day shift  .so for example their usual night shift capacity is 40-50%, so for  calculation ,lets take 50% as example  Day shift capacity reduced to 60% , hence 40% lost  Night shift compensate by increasing 10%  from 50% to 60% capacity Hence overall 30% hit on capacity with 70% running ad per usual ...it's painful but then its just short term la, undeniable stocks market is emotional but then  stocks market is 6 months 9 months ahead of present ma  PEACE"

INARI,studentt,3 posts,2021-05-21 12:32:00,"Hi GooShen. Yeah I'm a student, this pandemic gives us a lot of good learning scenario. As a student, I would appreciate if you could share some technical analysis/explanation, or you could just completely ignore me too. When looking at fundamentals, on paper we project future CF for eg. over long term. Having rapid sell down in short period for stock like this with good future prospect is a good case study for us.  I've seen the comments above, looking not for target price but the sound technical points that people might make which we have not looked into. You put ample attention to this stock and focus a lot on short term fluctuations. No offence, being hate-motivated, seems like this stock has adversely affected you a lot or could be just your personality.   Good luck to you!"

INARI,CuriousLearner,9 posts,2021-05-07 14:55:00,"https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/analysts-positive-inari-amertro...  Analysts are positive on Inari Amertron Bhd’s RM1.07 billion private placement.  In a note, TA Securities Research analyst Wilson Loo pointed out that while the proposed private placement will be dilutive to earnings per share (EPS) on the onset, he is positive on the move as the proceeds raised will bode well and come in handy, especially for sizeable and accretive acquisitions and investments, while also alleviating potential stress on its balance sheet.  “More notably, by pursuing a private placement, Inari will also have the opportunity to rope in strategic investors to realise synergies,” he said.  Loo said if Inari is able to raise RM1.07 billion from the exercise, he estimates the company's cash position will more than double to RM1.82 billion, from RM755 million at the end of the first quarter of the calendar year 2021 (1Q21).  At the same time, a private placement of 10% of its total issued shares is expected to have an EPS dilution of 9.1%.  Loo has maintained his target price (TP) of RM4.33 and “buy” call on the stock.  Meanwhile, PublicInvest Research’s Chua Siu Li was also positive on the move, as the funds are necessary for the firm to expand and grow at a faster pace.  “The current global chips shortage will boost the need for more assembly and testing services; therefore, any investments and capacity expansions will be timely, allowing Inari to ride on and better benefit from the upcycle,” Chua said.  Based on an enlarged share base of 3.77 billion shares (which includes the placement shares and 91.5 million employee share options scheme [ESOS] options being fully exercised), the impact of EPS on the group will be around 11%. Chua maintained the research house's “outperform” call and RM4.40 TP.  RHB Research’s Lee Meng Horng pointed out that the group is setting on RM755 million in net cash as of the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2020 (2QFY21) and operations cash flow generation ability exceeding RM300 million a year, combined with the RM1.07 billion to be raised in the proposed placement, does allude to a potential imminent sizeable merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunity that is value accretive, especially after weighing its prudent capital expenditure (capex) investment cycle over the past few years.  “Besides, raising its war chest in such a prevailing upcycle market valuation could be optimal from its capital structure point of view,” Lee noted.  The RHB analyst said that on a pro forma basis, the EPS dilution would be at 9.1% on the assumption that the maximum scenario under the placement is achieved. Net assets per share could rise to 65 sen, while net cash share may increase to 54 sen, from 23 sen currently.  When contacted, one anonymous analyst viewed that deploying a private placement is a faster way of raising funds versus a cash call such as a rights issue.  “In this current environment, it is now a great time to raise money via a share placement. However, it may not be such a good time to conduct M&A activities because of the high valuations involved in the sector,” the analyst noted.  As such, given Inari’s conservative M&A track record, the analyst expects a sensible investment to be made by Inari and that it should be within the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) space. Still, the analyst said this is contingent on Inari securing a good deal for any potential M&A targets.  The analyst was cautious over the placement in general. While a private placement means more expeditious fundraising, shareholders would have to put faith in Inari that it will eventually make a purchase that delivers value, in contrast to the group announcing from the get-go that it would be acquiring a specific company.  The company announced yesterday to Bursa Malaysia that it wants to raise up to RM1.07 billion via a private share placement to be used for capex, acquisitions and investments.  Under its proposed placement, Inari will issue up to 333 million new shares — which accounts for 10% of its share capital — to third party investors at an indicative price of RM3.20 a share.  The placement is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021, the group said, adding that its share capital will rise to 3.77 billion shares after the placement and the full exercise of the group's ESOS.  The private placement is the largest among local semiconductor-related firms which seek to take advantage of the current share price rally.  At noon market close, shares in Inari were 2.76% or nine sen lower at RM3.17, valuing it at RM10.59 billion. It saw 7.32 million shares done."

INARI,gohkimhock,1940 posts,2021-05-08 12:30:00,"When each time a private placement is called, you have to look back at the company's fundamental. If the fundamental is strong, most likely the pp can help further strengthen the health of the company. In this case, Inari.   If that's a week company calling for pp, then you should be wary. After the pp, the money would have gone into purchase of something which might not exist at all, only a fake invoice, or buy something extremely expensive from a seller. And this seller is controlled by the same parties. You can find this kind of companies easily in Bursa Casino."

HARTA,NatsukoMishima,430 posts,2021-07-23 14:08:00,【新冠肺炎】抗疫到“关键时刻”　美又现“超级真菌”致3死  （华盛顿23日讯）美国疾病预防和控制中心(CDC)主任瓦伦斯基，当地时间周四再次对美国当前疫情发出紧急呼吁，警告称美国尚未完全脱离疫情。另一方面，美国出现“超级真菌”传播事件，已造成3人死亡。  中新网报导，瓦伦斯基表示，印度变种病毒Delta是科学家见过的最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。  她强调，Delta比之前的（新冠肺炎）毒株更具侵略性和传染性。 “这是我们目前所知的、也是我从业20年以来所见的，最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。”   Delta目前正在全美迅速传播，截至本周，在已测序的病例中，感染该变种病毒的病例已经占到总数的83%；而在7月初，这个数字还只有50%。  瓦伦斯基还对全美疫情发出警告，称Delta正在低疫苗接种率地区广泛传播，这是美国又一个抗疫的“关键时刻”。  瓦伦斯基恳请尚未接种疫苗的人“严肃对待Delta ”。她强调，“这种病毒不会自动放弃，它会不断搜寻脆弱的人并感染他们。请考虑接种疫苗，并在此前注意防疫”。  《纽约时报》指出，这与白宫数周前的态度形成鲜明对比。独立日期间，美国总统拜登在白宫南草坪举行盛大派对，宣布美国“从疫情中独立了”。  报导称，瓦伦斯基最新的表态显示，官方越来越担心已经取得的成就正在丧失，当前激增的病例可能让那些疫苗普及率低、住院率高的地方卫生系统不堪重负。  3类主要药物无效  另一方面，美国卫生官员周四表示，现在有证据表明，一种“无法治愈”的真菌在两家医院和一家疗养院内传播，已造成3人死亡。  根据美国疾控中心的报告，华盛顿特区的一家疗养院和得州达拉斯地区的两家医院爆发“超级真菌”感染。少数患者患有侵袭性真菌感染，3类主要药物对这些感染都是无效的。  美国疾控中心的博士莱曼称，“这确实是我们第一次开始看到耐药性聚集病例”，其中患者显然是在相互感染。  多年来，卫生官员在发现一些常用药物对真菌感染情况几乎无效后，就一直对这种超级真菌的可能出现发出警告。  2019年，医生在纽约诊断出3起病例，这些病例也对一类称作为棘白菌素的药物具有抗药性，该药物被认为是对抗真菌感染的最后一道防线；但在纽约的病例中，没有证据表明感染已在患者之间传播。科学家得出结论是，治疗过程中形成了对药物的耐药性。  不过，美国疾控中心对于最新出现的病例得出结论，这些真菌感染确实进行了传播。  在华盛顿特区，一家专门收治重病患者的疗养院中出现101例感染耳念珠菌病例，其中3例对所有3种抗真菌药物均具有抗药性。达拉斯地区两家医院的感染集群有22人，其中两例具有这种抗药性。  根据美国疾控中心的说法，这些病例发生在2021年1月至4月。在治疗完全无效的5人中，有3人死亡，其中两人是得州的医院病患，另一人在华盛顿。  莱曼表示，两地的病例都在持续爆发，自4月以来还发现了其他感染。但新增病例尚未被报告。  调查人员查看了医疗记录，没有发现这些集群中的患者以前使用过抗真菌药的证据。卫生官员表示，这意味著它们会在人与人之间传播。

HARTA,bang_miskin,35 posts,2021-07-23 16:43:00,"Agree there's a lot of uncertainty in the glove market. Despite surge in cases, we are no longer in mid-2020 where glove price reached the sky. The consensus is that we are approaching a ""new normal' when many countries reached herd immunity. Maybe we'll get there in a year or two.   I, on the other hand, believe that despite the vaccine, the Covid remains endemic in the foreseeable future. Just like the ""Spanish fly"", it just won't go away, because in many countries there's a sizable anti-vax population. And the poorer parts of the world still haven't reached herd immunity, so emergence of a new strain is very likely. So we'll see continued usage of gloves, even if ASP has gone down.  I choose Harta not because it's the industry leader, I choose it because it's a well managed company, it's a cautious approach in these bearish market (if I am willing to take more risk, I'll buy supermx or topglov instead). I'm here for the long run and buy more stocks when prices dip.  Just my RM0.02"

According to him, the tax will enable the Government to increase its financial resources as well as help the people who are affected and increasingly squeezed by the Covid-19 pandemic.  “This windfall tax is not an unusual thing...this may help the Government because in this time of emergency and Covid-19 problem, we have to spend a lot because we need to help the poor, to give out extra income and we need to feed people who have no food.  “So all these need to be done and require money.

According to him, the tax will enable the Government to increase its financial resources as well as help the people who are affected and increasingly squeezed by the Covid-19 pandemic.  “This windfall tax is not an unusual thing...this may help the Government because in this time of emergency and Covid-19 problem, we have to spend a lot because we need to help the poor, to give out extra income and we need to feed people who have no food.  “So all these need to be done and require money. But if we follow taxes normally, there will be less (economic) activities and the Government will also get less taxes,"" he said as a member of the forum panel entitled 'Can the Malaysian Economy be Saved?' which was posted on Facebook Reset Malaysia today."

Committee chairman Didier Houssin acknowledged to reporters that ""recent trends are worrying.""

But the committee warned that worse could lie ahead, pointing to ""the strong likelihood for the emergence and global spread of new and possibly more dangerous variants of concern that may be even more challenging to control.""

Rubin told the panel that without eliminating the virus, even a vaccinated population could “collapse under the next variant.”  “An infectious carrier of the delta variant will infect his family even when they are fully vaccinated. If you live with a child who is a delta carrier, he will infect the parents,” he said, adding that Israel was seeing serious cases and hospitalizations even in fully vaccinated patients."

""Covid UK news – live: Deaths up by 50% as 19 July lockdown lifting ‘throws vulnerable to wolves’""   根據 WSJ 的報導, 這些感染（97%）主要來自於 Delta 變異病毒. 詳情參考:  https://cn.wsj.com/articles/%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%93%E4%BA...  英國已成為測試疫苗有效性的“試驗場”。但值得慶幸的是，在英國公共衛生發布的兩項研究中指出，其中第一項於5 月發表，表明接種兩劑輝瑞新冠疫苗的人群可獲得88%免受德爾塔（Delta）變體感染的保護，而阿斯利康疫苗僅提供60% 的保護。  我們需要認識到病毒存在變異的事實, 尤其是目前的 Delta 變異病毒的傳染能力更加強大與危險. 而現有市場上的疫苗則是根據當時即有的病毒進行分析後所製作的疫苗, 不管是 mRNA, 腺病毒载体疫苗（adenovirus ), 或者是滅活疫苗（inactivated virus）. 所以防護的有效性將會被減弱, 感染的機率也會被增加.  根據2021/06/01最新WHO的全球新型冠状病毒候选疫苗开发前景報告顯示, 臨床前開發與臨床開發中的疫苗分別有著185款與102款. 疫苗開發的類型目前共有10款 (mRNA疫苗, 滅活病毒疫苗, 病毒載體疫苗, 重組蛋白疫苗, etc.). 疫苗的開發正持續不斷的在進行中, 並未間斷. 這是一場賽跑, 病毒與疫苗的一場抗疫競賽.   預防 Covid-19 最好的辦法還是接種疫苗，通過接種疫苗，如果人群當中有免疫力的達到了一定的閾值，就可以降低新冠的流行強度或者阻斷它的流行，以達到降低感染率、降低重症率、降低病死率的目的。  另外, 大家需要明白. 接種疫苗後並不意味著不會被感染與確診, 但可以確定是能夠將傷害降至最低. 所以做好個人防護措施, 穿戴口罩, 勤洗手這些都是必要的 SOP. 這樣才能保護好自己與家人."

HARTA,kamirise360,101 posts,2021-07-07 16:25:00,"EMCO: Suspension of glove factories' operations affect earnings, overseas interests, says Maybank IB - save malaysia! | I3investor   EMCO: Suspension of glove factories' operations affect earnings, overseas interests, says Maybank IB Author: savemalaysia  Publish date:  Wed, 7 Jul 2021, 12:30 PM  KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 — The temporary shutdown of glove factories will not only affect companies’ earnings but could also jeopardise their relationships with overseas buyers, especially when Malaysian glovemakers are facing escalating competition from China’s glovemakers.  In a research note today, Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) noted that Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan had suspended the operations of their respective glove manufacturing facilities in Selangor yesterday due to the enforcement of the Enhanced movement control order (EMCO).  The investment bank said it was taken aback by the latest development as the glove is one of the personal protective equipment (PPE) essential items, and the factories had been allowed to operate during the first MCO.  “Assuming a two-week suspension of glove factories in Selangor under EMCO, we expect our financial year 2021 (FY21) core net profit forecasts for Top Glove and Kossan to decline by 7.4 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively,” it said.  Maybank IB forecasts that Hartalega’s net profit could drop by 16 per cent in FY22 due to the suspension of operations.  It added that the suspension of the glove factories in Selangor is expected to affect about 55 per cent of Top Glove’s and 100 per cent of Hartalega and Kossan’s total production capacity.  The investment bank noted that while the impact on the glove companies’ earnings is still manageable and temporary, investor’s sentiment towards the glove counters could be further eroded by the latest development.  The sector’s outlook is currently clouded by ongoing negative news such as declining average selling price (ASP) due to intensifying competition among the new and existing glove players, as well as environmental, social and governance risks.  In a separate note, AmInvestment Bank said the shutdown will likely decelerate the slide in the glove’s ASP, as supply is temporarily capped.  “We believe that the EMCO will be implemented for at least one month, before a return to MCO conditions.  “We do not discount the possibility that these companies will be granted approvals to resume production, given the importance of gloves in managing the spread of Covid-19,” it added.  The investment bank adjusted its fair values of glove companies to incorporate the EMCO and MCO disruptions, slower declines in glove’s ASP and a sharp drop in post-pandemic glove demand.  It had also lowered its price-to-earnings ratios to factor in the factory closure-induced negative investor sentiment.  “We urge investors to look past supernormal profits brought about by the spike in cases due to the Delta variant.  “The variant may result in gentler drops in quarterly earnings, but we doubt it will affect post-pandemic glove demand in a significant way, even if the virus becomes endemic,” said AmInvestment Bank.  It noted that the Delta variant would slow the fall in glove’s ASP, as glove urgency is buoyed by the rise in cases, and the smaller decline in the ASP would help support earnings of the glove companies in the next 12 months.  As at 10.45am, Hartalega rose three sen to RM7.09, Top Glove fell two sen to RM3,92, and Supermax was flat at RM3.14. — Bernama    https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2021/07/07/emco-suspension-of-glo...

HARTA,observatory,303 posts,2021-07-07 20:17:00,"The following paragraphs are extracted from Am Investment Bank report today. The research house has turned bearish about the future glove demand, which I don't necessarily agree. But it's still good to consider its contrarian view from Margma and Frost & Sullivan.  ""Post-pandemic demand projections are still overblown. We believe that the first post-pandemic year will see a flattish to negative growth in glove demand, as opposed to steady growth projections by Frost & Sullivan and MARGMA. This remains intact, as the expected fall in Covid-19 cases is postponed rather than cancelled.  We maintain our view that lasting glove demand is not so much driven by a blanket “paradigm shift” brought about by increased healthcare awareness. Instead, it is driven by more organic sociopolitical and legal structural issues such as healthcare outreach, enforceability of glove mandates as well as medical malpractice laws. These imply a slower and more gradual growth than current demand projections."""

However it brings up a factor I've not considered before. Is future demand growth driven by ""increased healthcare awareness"" as touted by Margma and F&S, or by ""enforceability of glove mandates as well as medical malpractice laws"" as mentioned by AM? Maybe it's somewhere in between.  I agree current price seems reasonable. I've already added back Harta by stages since a few weeks ago, at higher prices than yours!"

This price is even lower than 2018 price! Time for me to return. Among the four big, Harta has always been most popular to EPF, fund house, foreign investment, etc. This is not a buy call. Do your homework, learn from experience. I had this counter for many years it was a hard decision to take profit last year but now looking back it was right and now I can buy more to support sweet Harta and keep for another many years. To me, Harta has the best management, no gimmicks, no dramas suitable for mature investors. The rules of investment always stand - pick good companies, buy low and top up lower and wait and sell high. My friend say but you don't when is the lowest and highest. Yes you don't get to have the lowest and highest you only need to be in between!"

HARTA,observatory,303 posts,2021-06-27 20:31:00,"@akun, thanks for sharing the summary of Grandview Research on disposable gloves market. I reproduce the link below. https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/disposable-gloves-...  I note different organizations give very different projections. Grandview Research projects that the disposable gloves market, consisting mainly of natural rubber, nitrile, vinyl and a few other types of gloves, has a market size of US$10.17 billion in 2020. It is forecasted to grow to US$14.87 billion by 2028. The CAGR is 9.2%.  The first thing I note is the growth of $10.17 billion to $14.87 billion over an 8-year period represents a CAGR of only 4.9% instead of 9.2%. May be the meaning of “market size” is not the same as “revenue”. Still it’s confusing.  Another point is recently MARGMA President MARGMA president Dr Supramaniam Shanmugam said ““Post pandemic, we think, demand for gloves will still grow more than pre-Covid-19 rates, with an estimated annual growth of between 12% and 15%, compared with an annual growth of 8% to 10% before Covid-19.”.  https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/margma-says-glove-demand-expect...  In other words, MARGMA is more bullish than Grandview by projecting 12% to 15% growth even after the pandemic. Grandview only projects 9.2% from 2020 to 2028, which cover both pandemic (higher growth) and post pandemic (lower growth) period.  It’s unclear to me how credible is Grandview Research. However, MARGMA could also be biased given its close tie with the industry.   Nonetheless, it’s beneficial to read a diverse range of opinions out there. Thanks for the sharing."
HARTA,observatory,303 posts,2021-06-27 20:45:00,"A more bullish industry growth forecast can be found on Page 89 of Top Glove Hong Kong listing document https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2021/103230/documents/sehk2102260198...  Frost & Sullivan says “It is expected that the sales volume and revenue of the glove industry will reach 1,285.1 billion pieces and US$24,900.4 million in 2025, representing CAGRs of 15.9% and 19.1%, respectively, from 2019 to 2025.”  To summarize, we have 1.	Grandview Research that projects 9.2% CAGR from 2020 to 2028 2.	MARGMA that projects 12% t0 15% annual growth after the pandemic 3.	Frost and Sullivan that projects 19.1% CAGR from 2019 to 2025."

When countries open up, more people will return to work, play and travel.  When more peoples return to work, play and travel, demand for gloves will go up even more.  New normal dictates that gloves are not just for the medical/health sector alone.  Don't believe me?  I went to a bank yesterday and saw even some tellers were wearing gloves, not all of them though. It is not far fetched to suggest that very soon it could become company policy to supply gloves to all their front line staff.  Just imagine all the other sectors other than medical where people starts wearing gloves as a precaution for example aviation, f&b, cashiers, barbers, masseurs, beauticians etc etc. I can go on and on until tomorrow...  The more countries open up, the more the demand for gloves will be.  One more thing, even if the market crashes tomorrow, gloves will remain strong solely due to its extraordinary earnings for years to come.  Now tell me, are there other such counters in bursa other than gloves?  Please let me know if there are."

HARTA,Will76,574 posts,2021-06-21 12:31:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (June 21): PublicInvest Research has downgraded the rubber glove sector to ""neutral"" as it expects average selling prices (ASPs) for the sector to decline gradually in the second half of the year (2H21), following the improving Covid-19 situation in both the largest glove consuming markets, the US and the European Union (EU).  Its analyst Chua Siu Li in a note today cut her earnings forecasts for the sector by 10% to 35% on the back of lower ASP assumptions.  According to her, the improving Covid-19 situations in the US and EU resulted in much lesser urgency for distributors to immediately replenish inventories back to usual levels of two to three months.  “The buyers are adopting a more careful stance currently to avoid locking in purchases at high prices.  “We expect ASPs of gloves to start trending lower in the second half, supported by the improved Covid-19 situation as well as lower raw material prices as tight supply of nitrile butadiene latex continues to ease and [with a] better yield for latex concentrate after the end of the wintering season in May,” she said.  She also noted that glove makers’ commitment to stepping up on their social compliance practices will also translate into higher costs going forward, and she reckoned that it would take time for glove makers to fully pass on the cost increase to buyers, so it should result in margin compression in the near term.  Chua downgraded her rating of Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd to ""neutral"", with a lower target price (TP) of RM3.65.  “We cut our FY21 to FY23 earnings forecasts for Kossan by 37% to 51% to account for the expected decline in ASPs,” she said.  She also maintained her ""neutral"" call on Top Glove Corp Bhd but lowered her TP to RM4.40."

PublicInvest Research : *** We downgrade our rating for Kossan to Neutral, while maintaining our Neutral call on Top Glove.  *** Our preferred exposure for the sector is Hartalega, due to its superior margins pre-Covid and we continue to rate it as Outperform."

HARTA,Will76,574 posts,2021-06-09 22:52:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (June 9): Top Glove Corp Bhd expects average selling prices (ASPs) of gloves to drop further in the coming month due to weaker demand from the US and lower raw material costs.  Its executive director Lim Cheong Guan noted that the ASP of nitrile gloves fell 20% in Top Glove's third financial quarter ended May 31, 2021 (3QFY21).  ""The ASP adjustment was in line with market pricing trends and lesser sales volume to the US,"" he told a virtual press conference held in conjunction with the announcement of the group's latest quarterly results.   Lim expects lower nitrile latex prices as costs of the raw materials, namely butadiene and acrylonitrile, are expected to decline by 10% and 6% respectively between May and August.  ""A lower natural rubber latex concentrate price is expected in the coming months as the wintering season ended in May 2021, and yields are expected to improve,"" he added.  The world's largest glove manufacturer posted a softer quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) performance for 3QFY21.  Its net profit fell 29.03% to RM2.03 billion from RM2.87 billion for 2QFY21, while revenue shrank 22.42% to RM4.16 billion from RM5.37 billion, as the group was barred from exporting to the US.  The group said the weaker q-o-q performance was owing to a decline in ASPs by 16%, a lower sales quantity following a temporary halt in shipments to the US from Malaysia and higher latex as well as natural rubber latex concentrate prices.  On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, the group’s quarterly net profit jumped almost five times to RM2.04 billion from RM347.9 million a year earlier on a higher revenue.  Revenue climbed to RM4.16 billion for 3QFY21 from RM1.69 billion previously.  Despite the weaker earnings performance, Top Glove declared a dividend of 18 sen a share, including a special dividend of 5.3 sen.  Top Glove gained six sen to close at RM4.84 today, with a market capitalisation of RM39.72 billion. It saw 34.54 million shares traded."

HARTA,observatory,303 posts,2021-06-17 17:25:00,"It’s interesting to see the Big Four practicing different Share Buy Back (SBB) strategies.  Top Glove made headlines in Sep last year with its aggressive SBB. It had since bought about 200 million shares from a price as high as RM8 to the last batch at RM5.78 in Feb 2021. But it stopped its SBB after that even though price has become much lower (RM4.6 now).  Kossan had limited SBB from Dec to Mar. Only 6 million shares were purchased in total.  Supermax bought over 100m shares mostly last year. It distributed some Treasury shares at year end. Last SBB was Jan at price above RM6. But like Top Glove, it stopped SBB even though price has now dropped to RM3.6.  Harta only began its SBB in April this year. It has bought about 7m shares ranging from RM8.X to RM10.X  It seems that the SBBs at Harta and Kossan are more rational, and they are more aligned with long term shareholders’ interest. Either a company management doesn't do SBB; or when they buy, they should buy at lower prices. SBB at high price but stops when price goes south, while the company is still cash rich, looks either opportunistic or short-sighted."

The Malaysian firm, which is already listed in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, flagged in late April it would sell 793.5 million shares in the listing, half what the company proposed in its application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in February.  However, the deal has stalled as the company awaits indications from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on whether an imports ban would be lifted any time soon, the sources said.

HARTA,roger3210,473 posts,2021-06-04 01:23:00,ANEKA（0226）业绩分享 以去年上市的公司来说，鲜少有公司至今依然处于低于 IPO 的价位 – 而今天分享的 ANEKA 以目前来说，对比其 IPO 价格的 RM 0.330 一股还低；那今天的分享将会讲述 ANEKA 的业绩、公司的前景以及公司的估值。不过由于公司并无按年可比较的数据，因此将主要对比 FY 2021 Q1 为准。  • ANEKA 在该季度（“FY 2021 Q2”）的营业额为 RM 29.3 Million，对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 32.1 Million 下跌了 8.63%；而以目前来说，公司有约 RM 27.0 Million 或 92.00% 的营业额来自于马来西亚的业务，剩余的 8.00% 则是来自于印尼方面的业务。  • 管理层在季报内有提到，公司因为 MCO 2.0 而导致工程被拖缓；不过据我所知，公司在 MCO 后打桩机的使用率偏高，甚至于需要租借同行的机械来进行工程 – 反映出公司的业务已经持续出现了好转。  • 虽然公司并无提及他们的订单，但公司在近期内持续获得多个建筑项目的订单；如公司获得 Nakano Construction Sdn. Bhd.（“NCSB”）价值 RM 28.9 Million 的订单、同时也获得了 Gaya Kuasa Sdn. Bhd.（“GKSB”）价值 RM 16.4 Million 的订单以及最近其公司获得 IJM Construction Sdn. Bhd.（“ICSB”）价值 RM 77.8 Million 的订单，合计为 RM 123.1 Million，这除了反映出 ANEKA 的订单状况良好之外，也显示出建筑领域 – 尤其是私人领域依然在持续发展中。  • 另外，公司在 Note A9 内虽然提及公司分别有建筑业务（“Construction”）以及设备租凭（“Rental Equipment”）的业务；不过为了避免读者亲自阅读季报会混淆，直接参考建筑业务就行，基本上租凭的业务是公司属于自己的业务，在最后会被回扣出来。  • 以毛利而言，公司在该季度的毛利为 RM 4.8 Million，对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 5.2 Million 下滑了 7.25%；管理层提及该季度的业绩下滑主要是因为营业额下滑，不过毛利率在该季度也从 16.14% 提升到该季度的 16.39%。  • 以净利而言，公司在该季度的净利为 RM 1.4 Million，对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 0.5 Million 亏损则是改善了 399.14%；这主要是因为在 FY 2021 Q1 公司有一次性的 RM 2.2 Million IPO 费用导致亏损加剧 – 接下来公司并不会再被 IPO 费用影响。  • 提及 IPO 集资的资本来说，ANEKA 在近期也做出了非常有趣的举动；即公司原本将购置一台钻孔直径为 2.5 米、钻孔深度为 87.0 米的钻孔机械更换为暂钻孔直径 3.7 米、钻孔深度为 100.0 米的机械，另外也将原本打算偿还银行贷款的资金用在购置该钻孔上 – 以个人对于公司的了解，若非业务良好，公司鲜少会将偿还贷款的数额用在购置机械上，配合上述公司获得的合约，很难不想象公司接下来的业绩会持续改善。  • 以净经营现金流而言，公司在该季度的净经营现金收入为 RM 3.1 Million，而对比 FY 2021 Q1 的 RM 2.6 Million 净流出来说改善了许多；不过客观而言，建筑领域的现金流并不稳定，因此最好还是等待整个财政年完成再做出对于现金流的评估。  • 以公司的现金而言，目前 ANEKA 剔除在银行高达 RM 8.7 Million 的定存以及 RM 2.8 Million 的银行透支，实际流动现金为 RM 12.4 Million；虽然债务高达 RM 27.3 Million，但绝大部分都是贸易用的贷款，通常都为短期，因此短期内，公司应暂无现金流方面的问题。  • 目前 ANEKA 也依然并未公布派发任何股息。  以 ANEKA 这家公司来说，公司对比起其他的建筑领域的公司确实缺少曝光率。不过我们看到公司最坏情况已经过去，业务也随着公司获得众多合约有望持续改善。不过要回到公司巅峰的表现依然需要一段时间 – 而目前公司的估值为 52.12 倍的 P/E，若是以每个季度 RM 1.5 Million 的净利来计算的话，折合净利为一年 RM 6.0 Million；根据这样的计算方式而言 ANEKA 的未来 P/E 估值大约为 26.83 倍。  而有趣的是，公司的同行 ECONBHD（5253）目前依然是负 P/E 估值，而 PTARAS（9598）则是较为合理，目前在 12.25 倍。但已过去打桩领域来说，普遍比一般的建筑公司高出 2 倍左右的估值（ECONBHD 以及 PTARAS 的 5 年平均值分别为 32.10 倍以及 21.10 倍），因此 ANEKA 如果持续获得新的合约，继续成长下去的话，则是非常不错的。配合目前市场因为疫情而恐慌，ANEKA 的股价也并无太大的波动，或许大家可以开始关注这家比较被市场冷落的建筑公司。

HARTA,bang_miskin,35 posts,2021-06-08 16:09:00,depends on your goal. Very short term better cut loss or sell when price is high. Intend to hold for few years can top up when price is down. I think this company worth keeping medium long term. I intend to hold. My loss my choice.

The recent downward movement in price has brought us to the technically important level of 0.395. Failure to find support at this level may accentuate the bearish move. The RSI indicator is giving a reading in the oversold region. This may indicate the price decline may be over-extended. The price and volume action at the 0.395 support level is to be monitored carefully."

Now all approvals come from the federal govt, not allowing regional and local govt individuals to collect rent. The federal govt has already inspected NGY in relation to the POD last Dec.

GLOTEC,flyby,75 posts,2020-02-05 13:33:00,"Buy glotec because the downside is low.  Downside is protected by their manufacturing growth.  However the main reason to buy glotec is because their upside can be explosive.  The reason is that their coalbed methane potential is very good.  They have applied for POD1 about 2 years ago.  The indonesian govt is in the process of cleaning up their licensing procedure.  Once the POD1 is approved, all the current revenue stream of glotec will be very small compared with the revenue from cbm. Cheers."

GLOTEC,derrickinvestor,8361 posts,2018-12-13 00:30:00,pull it off? u mean dropnto 0.04 again?
GLOTEC,commonsense,490 posts,2018-12-13 10:05:00,"If you can look pass all the corporate announcement of new ventures and corporate exercises (share consolidation and free bonus warrants) and look at the company's fundamental, Globaltec is still a loss making company since at least FY2013 which is the year after the merger of AutoV, AIC Corp and Jotech Holding. It was surprising to see that the company turn straight away to loss making in 2013 given that prior to the merger of the 3 companies, they actually made a combine profit of RM37.6mil PAT in 2011.  I am not sure what went wrong in just 6 months after the merger. They still managed to make profit in the quarter after the merger but was not as high as before at only RM2.2mil PAT. Then it just got bad in 3Q13 when they posted their first time loses as a new company. Can anyone provide some clarity on this?  I think it is better for those that are interested to wait for them to post a more sustainable profit before you invest into the company.  If not, at least wait for a clearer picture on the development of the Tanjung Enim field which  is supposed to be the company future growth catalyst according to management.   The last development that i heard off was the completion of the exploratory/test drilling in the Muralim block last week by Nuenergy. I think they are still testing to see how much recoverable gas reserve are in the tested well. There is also another well that they are currently testing  but is yet to be completed. This is still not certain in term of recoverability. There could be gases in the 2 wells but might not be financially viable to extract. Hence why i think you should wait for the development of the well testing first before investing in this company.  For those already invested, you need to be prepare to face some market volatility in the short term. Maybe those invested could provide clarity on what are the other catalysts for the company besides the Nuenergy venture.  If you are looking to diversify your portfolio a bit (at least until the result of the Nuenergy test is out), i would recommend you to look at MBMR.  MBMR is a direct proxy to Perodua via its 22.6% interest in the company. Valuation is cheap at only 5.8x PE (based on target FY18 PATAMI of RM145mil. 9m PATAMI is already RM106mil). PB is low at only 0.6x BV. 4Q18 results is expected to be higher than 3Q18 and last year's 4Q17. For FY19 growth will be driven by the still high demand of new Myvi and the launch of the new SUV in 1Q19.   Please go through the analyst reports (https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/stk/pt/5983.jsp) and do your own analysis before making any decisions.   Good luck."

Decision makers decide for whose benefit? 80% directors for Saujana who holds 51% stake??? Why sell 51%, there would be investors who may be willing to buy at higher price for minority stake considering everything is in place except for the pod.  Surprise attack using shock tatics.  RAT is presented as a warm and trustworthy furry creature by the board.  Still 25% of profit is very good considering the size of CBM reserves.  Glotec is also doing well in the other fronts.

But after hearing that it will be consolidate to 20:1, I sold off all 5 million unit (50K lots) this morning even I lost around 200K.  I have bad experience in Hubline where I'm holding 1M units and consolidate to 20:1 and from RM0.01 to RM0.20. After less than a month, it drop to RM0.10 and currently at RM0.06.  I have a bad feeling that once Glotec consolidate to RM0.90 will easily go to RM0.30 or even worse less than RM0.10.  So you guys who still holding, becareful, I sold 5 million units @ RM0.04 and after it consolidate to 20:1 and if my prediction is correct and drop below RM0.30, I might buy back..."

GLOTEC,noviceinvestor8,2 posts,2018-09-07 09:43:00,"Thanks Doraemon for the valuable advise.   From my experience, almost all loss making company who consolidate (like Hubline), it will drop at least 20% to 30% within 1 week after consolidation. In Glotec case, all the while the share trading at around RM0.04 - RM0.05 and suddenly after consolidation to 20:1 and the price move to RM0.90, how many ppl will buy loss making company with RM0.90 (eventhough they throw in 4 units to 1 warrant, if mother share drop below RM0.50, the warrant is as good as useless)?? Not many ppl will look at the total share from 5 billion consolidate to around 250 million unit, they only look at current trading price, that is my opinion but many experience investor or fund manager might not agree with me on this."
GLOTEC,Depeche,3593 posts,2018-09-07 10:06:00,"The value of the company is unchanged after conversion...but if it's going to be sold down to 0.10 after conversion like some of u fear, then the management must be crazy...better stay put and remain a penny stock....but again, this company may not be one of those exceptional cases like Citigroup who managed to reverse their fortunes with reverse split.  Conclusion for me: look at company's fundamentals and prospects. This company does not impress in previous QRs....so like Hubline, best consider carefully before jumping in."

In a stock market filing today, the group said its subsidiary NuEnergy Gas Limited which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, had executed a memorandum of understanding with PT Pertamina Gas.   Under the MOU, NuEnergy and Pertamina Gas have agreed to exchange information and to jointly evaluate the economic viability of CBM gas supply from Tanjung Enim Production Sharing Contract’s (PSC) initial Plan of Development (POD) with the aim to utilize this CBM gas to fulfil Pertamina Gas consumer needs in Sumatra.   “NuEnergy has received government approval to prepare the POD for Tanjung Enim PSC. The proposed concept for the initial POD plans for the development in two target areas, in the north and north-west of the PSC where NuEnergy has focused exploration, drilling and pilot production activities over the last 8 years,” said Globaltec.   It added NuEnergy plans to submit the POD to the Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources by the end of 2017."

Even though the last quarter is profitable. So the 4th quarter result will be this month and if positive then it signal a milestone for the company to return to profitability solely from energy supplies business compared previous years.

BAT,getonwithit,96 posts,2021-07-19 14:12:00,over the last few months : checking on social media channels and a roadside area where mall working smokers usually smoke (as a sample) - i notice less complaints about unable to get illicit cigarette stock as well as more illegal boxes on the floor. therefore I do not expect this quarter to be better than last year's quarter. Delighted if proven wrong though!  Also i hope the company gives more details about their Settlement with the Health Ministry as per announcement on 22/6. The case was with regards to the following : https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bat-accuses-health-ministry-sel...

BAT,JJchan,6971 posts,2021-07-20 16:27:00,Maybe next 2 days results will be Out. BAT profit (hence Dividend ) should depends on Premium Cigs rather than KYO and RothMans ( competing with illegal and Local Brands ) Local Brands that did not pay Taxes are replacing Cigs from Indonesia ( due to Raging Covid there ) However Local Brands Cost are moving rapidly Up due to small manufacturing scale.  Imported premium Brand( illegal) has plunge 70% not bcos of very effective Checking but rather the logistics is Killing their profit rapidly.  Killing illegal Premium Brands would provide a Cushion for Falling demand of BAT premium Brand due current economic situation.  My estimate a QoQ increase from 8--10% Or 27% increase YoY ----Maybe RM 69mil profit

The framework is still subject to finalisation, nevertheless it reckoned there was a chance that the government may introduce regulations on nicotine vape products as early as the second half of the year."

BAT,Lanmum,292 posts,2021-06-15 21:59:00,"Tough operating landscape but BAT offers attractive dividend yield Tan Siew Mung / theedgemarkets.com  June 15, 2021 21:14 pm +08 Tough operating landscape but BAT offers attractive dividend yield -A+A KUALA LUMPUR (June 15): Earnings prospects of British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd (BAT) are not expected to be that rosy given the tough battle with illicit cigarettes, in addition to the competition from its new rival — vape.  However, CGS-CIMB noted that while there is little capital appreciation potential left after its share price has climbed 19% year from this year's low, BAT offers a rather decent dividend yield.  According to the research house, BAT's dividend yield would be in the range of 5.9% to 6.7% for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2021 (FY21) until FY23.  The dividend yield is based on an annual net profit forecast of RM289 million in FY21, an almost 22% year-on-year growth. However, it expects the cigarette maker's net profit to be on a decline in the following two years to RM270 million in FY22 and RM253 million in FY23, noting that the downside risks are shrinking sales volumes and pressure on margins as more smokers opt for cheaper products.  This translates into a dividend per share of 99 sen in FY21, 93 sen in FY22 and 87 sen in FY23.  Commenting on the operating landscape, according to CGS-CIMB, BAT told the analyst briefing that the group began to see its sales climb in March, two months after the government banned cigarette trans-shipment, which was blamed for providing a conduit for smuggling cigarettes.  BAT guided that illegal syndicates are now shifting their smuggling channels from ports to smaller jetties, and it is still too early to celebrate a win in the battle against the illicit trade.  ""Still, the group expressed confidence that it can generate more quarterly year-on-year sales volume growth in FY21, as it believes that some smokers have reverted to their former favourite legal brands,"" CGS-CIMB wrote in a research note today.  That said, CGS-CIMB highlighted that BAT is cognisant of the high pricing for legal cigarettes.  ""It echoed our view, saying that this 'honeymoon period' of sales growth may come to a halt someday, especially since many Malaysians' incomes are strained due to the economic impact of the series of Movement Control Order imposed since March 18, 2020,"" it wrote.  The research house commented that although the lockdown may have lured some lapsed smokers and caused people to light up more often, much of the sales growth has come from margin-eroding value-for-money (VFM) cigarettes.  BAT revealed at the briefing that VFM lines' share of sales was about 15% in 1QFY21 and has been growing by about three to four percentage points per annum.  Meanwhile, cheaper and unregulated electronic cigarettes and vaporiser products have also grown in popularity, as according to BAT, vape's share of Malaysia's enlarged tobacco market has risen from about 9% in 2019 to about 12% currently.  According to CGS-CIMB, BAT has appealed to the government to draft a regulation on vape but there has not been much progress as the government has been tied up with fighting against Covid-19 and Parliament has been suspended since January 2021.  BAT's share price was unchanged at RM14.56 today, valuing the group at RM4.16 billion.  Kathy Fong"

BAT,UncleFollower,376 posts,2021-06-08 18:02:00,A government for the people will slash rates and worry about inflation later.   Foreign money has been on the run not because of rates but because of political instability and poor visibility in recovery.   Then look at how the BNM governor and Finance Minister are talking  Thats why wkc is probably right because we have a heartless government right now

BAT,Fundamental123,603 posts,2021-05-31 21:13:00,"My 2 cents:  You should apply YOY comparison method, where there had been MCO since 18th of March 2020 before that there had been no MCO at all ( normal business) ; however, year 2021 Jan - Mar , CMCO had been implemented affecting some normal business.  What does the above mean for the company’s revenue for Q1 2021 as compared to revenue for corresponding period last year ?  How come revenue and profit margin for Q1 2021 were higher as compared to revenue and profit for corresponding period last year ? That experienced players are concerned about for investment but not the apparent figures .  Hopefully, my 2 cents is helpful to somebody for better understanding about above business performance by way of TA."
BAT,wkc5657,234 posts,2021-05-31 21:26:00,"Good place to start your que, but be flexible to adjust if you really want to enter.   Before entry, read the report from their big boss, big issue with smuggling through small jetty despite limited transshipment and almost no improvement toward black market share. His latest tone is not positive, so assume won't get any better from now on.  To be conservative, better base your forward valuation 250m profit a year. Conservative full year EPS of 90 cents at share price of rm15 gets you 6% dividend yield. Question is how will market evaluate it?   The vape product will still take some time to materialise since parliament is doing nothing to bring forward favourable legislations. Looking at this useless lineup in parliament, i personally don't think vape legislation will happen until the next general election settled."

BAT,240902,46 posts,2021-05-18 11:15:00,"From Nanyang ..Direct Translation: Good Read, Date 17 May 2021  2Consumer stocks are worthy of the fight against the black market, British American Tobacco  After my country announced the national control order, JPMorgan Chase conducted research on local consumer stocks and issued reports. British American Tobacco (BAT, 4162, main board consumer stocks) and Mr. DIY (MRDIY, 5296, main board consumer stocks) are the top choices.  The report points out that since the government raised domestic taxes to 40 cents per cigarette in 2015, forcing consumers to find cheaper alternatives, the market share of private cigarettes has soared from 37% to about 64% last year.  British American Tobacco's share price has also fallen from RM73 at its peak in December 2014 to the current level of around 14.5 ringgit. At the same time, the foreign shareholding ratio dropped from over 80% before the epidemic to 61% at the end of last year.  ""However, our proprietary fund prospectus states that none of the 19 flagship funds tracked and studied holds shares in British American Tobacco.  ""Therefore, we believe that the company's downside risks are very limited.""  In addition, the government introduced several measures in its budget at the end of last year to step up the crackdown on the smuggling market, and the regulatory measures for e-cigarettes are all potential positive factors.  The report added that the investment bank estimates that the market share of the private cigarette market should remain stable at 64% from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2023.  ""In addition, the government set a 10% domestic tax on e-cigarette devices in early January this year. We believe that the Malaysian government is taking the first step in the right direction.""  British American Tobacco has stated that once regulatory policies are in place, it will enter the e-cigarette market, which the investment bank believes will help expand its revenue base. The company has launched heated e-cigarette Glo and pod Neo in 2019.  After comprehensive consideration, JPMorgan Chase gave an ""overweight"" rating and set a target price of 21 ringgit, which is equivalent to a 5.1% interest rate for the next fiscal year."

KOTA BARU: More than 600 rat routes used by smuggling syndicates to bring in illegal items and immigrants into the country have been identified.

""Smuggling activities in the country is not a new issue. Currently, we have identified 678 rat routes but the number might increase or reduce from time to time as smugglers find new routes to avoid the authorities."

GENM,ongth60,483 posts,2021-07-16 20:48:00,"Like I said couple of hours ago...KUALA LUMPUR (July 16): Malaysia will soon allow the commercial sale of Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Chinese firms Sinopharm and Sinovac, Science Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said on Friday, as authorities try to ramp up inoculation rates amid surging cases. Malaysia has one of the region's highest number of coronavirus infections per-capita but also one of its fastest vaccination rates. About 39% of its adult population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.  The Sinopharm vaccine, which Malaysia approved on Friday for emergency use, would soon be open for private purchase, Khairy, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK) told a virtual news conference.  Meanwhile, Sinovac vaccines would be available commercially from Aug 1, after it has completed the delivery of some 15 million doses procured by the government, he said.  Malaysia on Friday reported 12,541 new coronavirus cases, bringing total infections to 893,323, including 6,728 deaths.  Malaysia had previously said it would stop administering Sinovac vaccines after supplies run out, and would instead rely largely on the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine for its national rollout.  On Friday, Khairy clarified that surplus Sinovac shots would remain available for those who may have allergy concerns with other vaccines.  ""There is no issue over Sinovac's efficacy,"" he said.  Malaysia would also consider purchasing more doses from Sinovac in the event of a shortfall of AstraZeneca vaccines from neighbouring Thailand, Khairy said.  Thailand said this week that it was considering limiting exports of locally-produced AstraZeneca vaccines to fight its own Covid-19 crisis, a move that could potentially disrupt supplies to its regional neighbours.  Khairy said Malaysia would seek assurances from Thailand that there would be no disruptions to supply."

GENM,ongth60,483 posts,2021-06-11 14:06:00,"Not really, for the same money invested, if genm is 10 % increment in price, depending of the warrant leverage, c-92 warrant would have gain at least 40% increment at the same time. The 40% profit would allow you to buy more stock. Similarly the downside is also multiply by the leverage, h hence it is risky."

COMFORT,IMwhatIM,385 posts,2021-07-24 14:57:00,"What we saw on the Comfort mother  share and WB price movements is a clear example of the need to diversify your portfolio to spread out the risk you are taking in portfolio management. Many investors believe that the mother share price MUST move up first before  the baby share ( WB). As we can see many were disappointed that WB has moved so much ( in % terms) but the mother price is still down there.  I am very sure many believe that the mother share is undervalued. And because the mother share price is undervalued, the premium on the WB appeared to be excessive and its price looked expensive. For this very reason, many were not willing to pick up WB at this price.  Comfort Gloves with its full order book and strong cash flow position, its undervalued  share price  will not stay at that  low level for long.  The market forces will definitely  push up the price to a more reasonable  level like minimum of RM3.00 to RM3.50.  At this more reasonable  level,  the current WB price of 71 cents is still a "" steal"".  For those who could see the picture  from this angle would have happily mopped up the WB when it was trading  at 40 to 60 cents.  Many in this chat room feel that the fair value of the mother share is RM5 to RM6. If you strongly believe  that then 71 cents is a rare bargain.  With mother and WB in your basket, you would have diversified  your portfolio and you can comfortably  sit back and sip your coffee and let the market decide  which one to move up first; the mother or the WB, knowing very well that both prices will have to move up. Its only a question of when.  Have a pleasant  weekend and let us meet up again at 9.00am sharp on Monday."

But if we look at the mother share. It just rose from RM 1.94(closing price) on 6/7 to RM 2.09(closing price) on 23/7, a mere increase of 7.7%.  What a clear mismatch! I can see big, fat frogs jumping on the street for people to catch. But beware, catch at your own risks.    Ahahah - Better stay away from this speculative warrant game.

COMFORT,IMwhatIM,385 posts,2021-07-21 11:52:00,"For a fundamentally sound company like Comfort Gloves, at today's prices it is still very much undervalued.  If you have not bought enough,  it is still OK to buy more.  There is still a lot of upside.   Many are very much influenced by the negative reports by IBs. All IBs have herd mentally. When a research house like JPM comes out with a negative report on glove sector, virtually all the local IBs blindly follow JPM.   If you keep believing in them then you will miss the opportunity of buying at these depressed prices. Most of the time IBs make the wrong call. Do you honestly believe that their research analysts are better than most of us? I very much doubt so.  I believe most of us here are more knowledgeable than them.

COMFORT,IMwhatIM,385 posts,2021-07-11 12:10:00,"The sales for the next 3 quarters are based on those that Comfort clinched last year with high ASPs. So we can expect the profits for the next 3 quarters to be  at least as good as the last quarter ( which was record-breaking), if not better. This will have positive impact on the price of Comfort shares.  After the 1st quarter of next year, the ASP will come off but because of the new Covid variants, the ASPs will not ""fall off the cliff"". The ASPs will gradually slide downwards. With the expansion of capacity, and with higher sales volume, the impact of the sliding prices is likely to be cushioned by higher orders which will still bring about higher level of profits.  No factories would want to increase their production capacity ( and incurring huge capital expenditure) if the operators cannot foresee earning higher level of profits.   In any businesses, product ASPs can come off when there are more players. That is normal. It is up to the individual factory to be more efficient and creative in product design to ward off competition.  It seems many of the research analysts are so easily taken away by the dropping ASPs that they make no effort to look at the bigger picture. Or there is herd mentality among them.  ASPs is only one thing, increasing  level of profits is a much more important factor to look at.   All businessmen will tell you the same thing: they all strive to increase the profit level in their companies."

These buyers also trade for themselves so they will off-load at higher prices once they are done with the buying.  Don't panic. The prices will definitely recover in due course.

During that period of abt 4 weeks,  in total, JPM was no where to be seen so the shares were not shorted. From there one can easily tell  that to bring it  from the current price of below RM2.00 to RM2.30 is chicken feed for the syndicate.

COMFORT,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-06-26 00:57:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- My E.G. Services Bhd has signed a letter of intent (LOI) to purchase 10 million doses of Anhui Zhifei Biopharmaceutical Co Ltd’s COVID-19 vaccine, ensuring that the corresponding quantity of its recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August.  In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, MYEG said it holds three-year rights to exclusively distribute the vaccine in Malaysia while through a separate partnership, the group has two-year exclusive distribution rights to the vaccine in the Philippines and is presently in discussions to distribute in other countries.  ""Last week, MYEG announced plans for the roll-out of a vaccination programme in the Philippines that will cover the provision of the vaccines to the public health segment as well as private sales,” it said.  The LOI is to ensure that the corresponding quantity of Zhifei’s recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August when vaccination through the private market is enabled.  ""This paves the way for the vaccine to be imported and made available to Malaysians as soon as the private market commences and subject to the conditional authorisation of the vaccine by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA),” it said.  The cost of the vaccine will be determined later subject to the conditional authorisation by NPRA.  MYEG said it is confident that when the Zhifei vaccine becomes available locally, it can play an important role in accelerating the country’s drive towards achieving herd immunity against the COVID-19 virus.  Jointly developed by Zhifei and the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the vaccine has fast emerged as among the preferred vaccines in China since gaining emergency use authorisation there in early March in view of its distinct inherent advantages as a recombinant protein subunit vaccine. More than 60 million doses have already been administered in more than a dozen provincial-level regions, including Beijing. The vaccine is also being used in Uzbekistan.  Recombinant protein technology is proven, having been used for the development of vaccines such as hepatitis B and shingles.  In addition, recombinant protein vaccines can be more easily produced at a large-scale since production does not need to be carried out in high-grade biosafety laboratories, and they are also more cost-effective and easier to store and transport.  Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, MYEG has leveraged its strengths and expertise as a leading digital services provider in the region to introduce a number of significant initiatives as part of a holistic solution aimed at helping in the fight against the pandemic.  Besides vaccines, these offerings include screening services, quarantine management and digital health travel pass systems."

QES,flyyoufools,164 posts,2021-07-16 19:23:00,"Relax, naysayers are not trend followers. They see up and down everyday, they run tails between their leg. Short minded people don't think, they act out of fear and greed. They feels like winner with 5%,10% profit. They are pissed when they sell early while the trend move more than what they gain or loss. We can see real life example of such losers in QES, like fruitcake and armanhashim. When qes trading around 50c, 60c from previous high 70c, they said the operator already took profit. The holders are trapped. Wait at 20c, 9c. When the price move onwards breaking new high upon new high, they keep their mouth shut. Now you know, they bought in early probably around 40c, 60c, took profit or loss, then bitter when price moves against them. Afraid to reenter, they comes bringing fear.   These types of people don't have conviction. They don't know when to sell, buy and hold. They got spooked easy, and they lashed out here.  Now question yourself, do you buy high and in the loss at the moment? Probably buy at 0.90 above? Should i hold for god how long to breakeven, or do i sell and take my loss like a man?  I'm not suggesting to either buy, hold or sell. You should know your game. Winners have conviction, losers listen to others for the next step.  Which one are you?"

So there is no wrong or right here. Apart from that on the comment saying the ""Pros"" comment only when it is on an uptrend please go check the comments for the last 6 months and then only put your point simply trash talking others will do you no good. Lastly I wold like to emphasize on "" Regression to mean"" what it means is no counter will be on an uptrend forever nor will it be on a downtrend forever eventually it will stabilize and the whole process will happen again."

The question is, is it true?  To confirm downtrend itself, what are your conviction? A week red does not necessarily means downtrend. Vice versa a week green does not means uptrend.  IMHO, the real downtrend does not take a week or two. Same goes to it almost impossible to TP at peak price when you don't know when rally gonna end.  All things considered, we can see the telltale of a downtrend from daily / weekly chart but confirmation of a downtrend itself requires another level of art"

Both parties had signed an agreement to set up the JV company, Applied Engineering Technology (M) Sdn Bhd (AET) to provide the services which range from prototyping to high volume production, according to a joint statement on Thursday.  The JV will cater to the specific needs of clients in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing, life science and medical devices, defence, and aerospace market segments, not only in Malaysia, but also to Asean countries and China.  The proposed initial investment for AET is about RM5mil with an initial workforce of 20 workers, comprising mainly engineers and technicians. The investment is set to expand up to RM20mil over the next three years.  AET looks to kick-start its operations in a temporary premise before moving to its new factory in Batu Kawan Industrial Park during the fourth quarter of 2022.  Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) CEO Arham Abdul Rahman said the electrical and electronics (E&E) and related services industries continue to assume a critical role in Malaysia’s industrial development.  He said they are part of the critical global supply chain and ecosystem to support other high technology industries.  “MIDA is optimistic that AE’s presence here will further boost the development of our high technology equipment ecosystem, enable more opportunities for our local vendors and spur high-employment for Malaysians,” he said.  AE president Jack Yao said MIDA had been crucial in enabling both companies to come together to set up the JV.  “Malaysia will provide the launching pad to AE’s strategical move to expand outside USA to service its major customers in Malaysia and the Asia Pacific.  AE will bring its latest generation of high-end technologies to Malaysia and builds up a whole new technology sector. A significant number of R&D activities are also planned for this new location. Malaysia can benefit its position as a technology-country and can strengthen the region as a high-tech manufacturing hub in Asia Pacific.”  QES Group president Chew Ne Weng said being a JV partner, it will play its role to support this high technology equipment manufacturing project using its established networks across Asean, China and other parts of Asia for AET to expand from Malaysia.  “QES hopes to leverage the well-established and technical strength of AE to further improve our manufacturing capabilities. Together with MIDA, QES anticipates AET will create a sustainable high technology equipment manufacturing eco-system within E&E and medical segments for Malaysia,” said Chew."

QES,anthonytkh,923 posts,2021-07-14 17:45:00,The rebound was expected based on TA. It hit the lower BB two days ago and below MA20. Around every 2.5 months there was retracement before a rebound (check graphs since Jan this year). The selling operator sat back a bit today but also took some profit from the big buying operator. No idea what that selling operator’s gonna do but chart shows start of another uptrend that may last for next 2.5 months

QES,billybob123,94 posts,2021-07-14 19:01:00,"KUALA LUMPUR: Semiconductor equipment manufacturers forecasts sales to exceed US$100bil (RM420bil) in 2022, which will be a new record as device makers continue to step up investments, according to a US-based semicon industry body.  The Semiconductors Equipment Manufacturers Industry (SEMI) said on Wednesday the global sales would be underpinned by original equipment manufacturers’ (OEMs) investments due to robust demand for memory and storage.  In its “Mid-Year Total Semiconductor Equipment Forecast – OEM Perspective” at the “Innovation for a Transforming World”, SEMI said continuing investments by device makers in secular growth drivers are fueling the expansion of both the front-end and back-end semiconductor equipment segments.  The wafer fab equipment segment, which includes wafer processing, fab facilities, and mask/reticle equipment, is projected to surge 34% to a new industry record of US$81.70bil in 2021, followed by a 6% increase in 2022 to more than US$86bil.  The foundry and logic segments, accounting for more than a half of total wafer fab equipment sales, will grow 39% year-over-year to reach US$45.7bil in 2021.  Underpinning this growth is the strong demand for leading-edge technologies powered by the digitisation of industries worldwide.  “The growth momentum is expected to continue in 2022 with the foundry and logic equipment investments rising another 8%, ” it said."

The brokers want you to trade as much as possible rather than holding or else they won't make commissions  I will tell you all an industry secret. Almost all brokers sign agreements with Facebook gurus that you pay fees to. They will promote stocks and hide their agendas in flashy advertisements, ostentatiously to help you manage money. However, in truth, their purpose is to make you either buy their bags or trade short term as much as possible for them to earn brokerage fees."

I follow since 0.3 From 0.3 it move to 0.5 then retract to 0.5+ before it advance to 0.6 then 0.7 retrace to 0.6+ and eventually now 0.8+ The uptrend is still intact(with some minor correction/retracement/pullback). Not many stock will rally on and on without taking a breather....... My opinion is, around 10% of correction is perfectly healthy.

Its just a minor consolidation from the recent growth and also with the affect of the market but QES will always rebound back and make ath again. Its a trend that we see here in this counter.

QES,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-07-11 00:51:00,马股下半年拨云见日 4大投资主题值得关注 2021年07月10日 下半年投资策略 （吉隆坡9日讯）尽管当前乌云密布，但随着本地疫苗接种加速，分析员认为，马股市场应会在下半年恢复元气，并点名股息、科技、商品和复苏主题的投资策略。  大华继显研究分析员在今日发布报告指出，群体免疫的乐观情绪，相信能消除政局不稳的忧虑；昨日富时隆综指挫跌1.4%，因为巫统宣布撤销对国盟的支持，引发投资者担忧。  “不过，我们认为市场在很大程度上，已消化了政治风险。更重要的是，未来潜在新政府采取的政策方向，也不太可能与国盟当前方针有太大偏差。”  因此，随着我国疫苗接种加速，焦点会重新转向经济重开的主题，分析员估计市场将从第三季中期开始复苏。  虽然马股市场复苏不均衡，但预计末季仍会持续复苏，归功于广泛市场赢家所引领。  “在末季达到群体免疫的目标，将令我国在明年可重开边境。”  同时，分析员列出年底综指1635点目标，等同本益比16.2倍，符合历史均值。  分析员还列出了下半年重要正面事件，包括本地封锁松绑，希望可在第三季底开放跨州、云顶（GENTING，3182，主板消费股）户外主题公园开张、特定种植股和商品股迎来异常强劲盈利季度，及年底实现群体免疫。  不过，关键风险则是下月单日卖空禁令将解除，及手套均价进一步潜在走低。  大华继显研究选股 综指明年底料冲1775点  放眼明年，当我国经济重开，并顺利展开复苏的前提下，分析员估计综指有显著上行空间。  “假设盈利增长1到2%，且估值恢复到疫前的16.9倍水平，综指明年底有望触及1775点。”  投资主题选股 近期催化剂不清晰  配合上述展望，分析员列出了4大投资主题，包括价值和高股息投资、科技股（受惠于需求增长、贸易转移及全球5G科技推出）、经济重开，及特定商品超级周期主题。  因此，分析员建议增持有价值的银行股、高股息的产托股、复苏主题的博彩股等、电子与制造业的特定出口股，及商品为主的特定提炼和种植股。  报告补充，分析员大型股首选为联昌国际（CIMB，1023，主板金融股）、云顶大马（GENM，4715，主板消费股）、益纳利美昌（INARI，0166 ，主板科技股）和MyEG（MYEG，0138，主板科技股）。  同时，还有齐力（PMETAL，8869，主板工业股）、双威（SUNWAY，5211，主板工业股）、马电讯（TM，4863，主板电信与媒体股）和云升控股（YINSON，7293，主板能源股）。  中型股首选合成种植（HSPLANT，5138，主板种植股）和腾达科技（PENTA，7160，主板科技股）；环境、社会与监管（ESG）股项首选为亚通、联昌国际、益纳利美昌、MyEG、双威和云升控股。  “不过，在近期市场催化剂不清晰之际，即冠病确诊病例高居不下，投资者最初只会青睐价值/股息和科技增长股。”  手套建筑料跑输大市  至于手套和建筑股，分析员相信下半年仍会跑输大市；这两大股项在今年上半年已显著跑输综指。  “在需求放缓和全球供应强劲增长情况下，手套商应该仍会因均价下跌而表现逊色。”  建筑股方面，虽然受益于房产销售显著恢复，但大型项目加速推进的希望渺茫，将令本就承受打击的建筑股表现不佳。

Now QES price at intermediate support. Lets see how the operator game goes. If price break RM1 the share movement already in different game. As the stock consider high price stock. More new investors and traders who only trade stock RM1 and above will come in and ride the share.

VITROX,emilychee,59 posts,2021-02-05 10:12:00,"Govt awards RM6.2 mil Smart Automation Grant to 66 SMEs, mid-tier companies KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 4): A total of 66 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-tier companies have been awarded the Government's National Economic Recovery Plan (PENJANA) 2020 #SMART Automation Grant (SAG). In a statement today, the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) said the grant, involving a total of RM6.2 million, was awarded to registered businesses in primarily traditional or non-technology activities from the services sector. MDEC chief marketing officer and head of digital investments and brand Raymond Siva said the outcome-based matching grant will assist these companies to accelerate automation and achieve productive results, such as increased revenues; savings in business costs; reduction of process time cycle and man-hours spent; and creating new sources of growth. “Each successful applicant had been allocated up to 50 per cent of their total project cost, subject to a limit of RM200,000, or whichever is the lowest, through this matching grant.   This means the successful applicants will pay at least 50 per cent of the total cost of the digitalisation project and, subsequently, receive the remaining amount based on the achievements of the agreed milestone deliverables, he said. MDEC said the SAG, which was launched in July 2020, had been conceptualised as a matching grant for companies in the services sector to spur them towards automating their business processes and pursue full digitalisation. The grant allocated from the 2020 PENJANA initiative aims to drive these businesses towards kickstarting the implementation of digital processes and the use of technology tools that will automate their business operations,” it said. MDEC noted that all of the 66 approved SAG recipients come from all over Malaysia, including service providers from the wholesale and retail trade (30 per cent); general services (24 per cent); and professional services (14 per cent). The other sectors consist of transportation and storage, tourism, education, healthcare, food and beverage, financial and insurance, and real estate and construction. Since its unveiling, this initiative solely focused on enabling digital adoption among businesses, which is a central part of MDEC’s three strategic framework pillars, namely Digital Jobs, Digital Businesses and Digital Investments. The agency continues to set the foundation for SMEs and mid-tier companies to thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era by focusing on empowering businesses at every level and in all sectors."

VITROX,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-04-10 16:59:00,"Pmbtech   Silicon: Semiconductor shortage impacting automotive industry  Posted 19th January 2021 in  Industry news. By Nils Backeberg   According to Reuters, automakers around the world have been caught off-guard by a shortage of semiconductors that has required the industry to compete against the consumer electronics industry for chip supplies. Leading semiconductor manufacturers reassigned capacity from automakers after the pandemic cut down vehicle sales, instead shipping chips to companies that produce smartphones, gaming systems and other electronic goods that remained in high demand.  Several companies, including Volkswagen, Nissan, Ford, Toyota and others, have been impacted and are struggling to secure the chips to maintain production lines. All chips, whether bound for a laptop or a vehicle, start life as a silicon wafer, an industry that has always struggled to keep up with sudden demand spikes.  Roskill View  Polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) is used in the production of silicon wafers.  Polysilicon remains only the third-largest end-use for silicon metal worldwide, however, it has been the fastest growing of the three major applications for silicon metal in the past two decades with its share of global demand rising from 3% in 2000 to 20% in 2019.  Silicon metal is consumed directly in the production of poly-crystalline silicon wafers for use in photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, and indirectly in mono-crystalline silicon wafers for use in semiconductors for integrated circuits and a range of electronic equipment. Until 2007, the production of mono-crystalline silicon wafers for use in semiconductors was the largest end-use for polysilicon. The consumption of silicon metal in polysilicon began to take off significantly after 2009, fuelled in part by generous subsidies for producers and consumers of solar products in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. By 2019, the proportion of global polysilicon demand accounted for by semiconductor applications had fallen to just 16%.  Though Asia accounts for about 70% of global silicon semiconductor wafer output, China remains a relatively small player with a market share of about 15%, in contrast to its dominance of the solar value chain. The leading producing countries are South Korea, Taiwan, the USA and Japan, with over 50% of supply consolidated into the five largest producers.  The rapid advancement of technology both drives and restrains the demand for silicon chips and wafers, and the constantly changing balance of these influences has led to a haphazard growth over the last decade, while silicon wafers in the solar industry have enjoyed a consistent growth. Looking forward, Roskill forecasts that the solar industry will continue to drive growth in demand for silicon metal with double digit increases in demand to 2023. Moreover, while semiconductor demand as a whole is expected to remain in the low single-digit growth rates over the next decade, the impacts of COVID-19 are already indicating a haphazard growth year in 2021."

All of you judged on the company price based on the financial performance. But you all do not understand how is their culture and value of the technology they have. This company can be known as ""Apple"" Malaysia version. Even the founder build their latest HQ building similar to Apple HQ design.  Founder and co-founder hold more than 50% of the total shares and if includes the BOD and employees it will make to around 75% while floating around free market is 25%. Most of the employees believe in the company and do not sell their share and keep it. Maybe will sell it if urgently need financial aid. Many of their employee already become millionaire in their portfolio for those still hold the share since 2006.  Their technology is niche and mostly use in semiconductor industry and some in military. In Malaysia, only this company has their own X-ray inspection technology and the value of the company is their value of the technology they have. You can read their annual report to get more information about this company.   You may study their chart since 2006 and see how it move up and previously this company listed in MESDEQ (ACE market) changed to Main board.  Oh ya, I will avoid HLG price target research as every time they CALL SELL, this company share price still getting up higher and higher."

You can compare Vitrox with ASML or Teradyne but that would not be so fair because those ang moh companies already existed very long time ago but Malaysia can produce companies like Inari and Vitrox is already mind boggling.

However, others are optimistic of a recovery in the coming quarters. The share price weakness is good buying opportunities.  ViTrox’s sharp net profit contraction was taken by the cautious investors as evidence of a possible slowdown in the semiconductor industry."

The moderation was mainly due the softness in machine vision solution (MVS) product line despite the favourable foreign exchange (forex). According to SEMI, the global semiconductor equipment market is projected to drop 18% to US$52.7 billion in 2019, reflecting rising market uncertainty due in part to geopolitical tensions. We downgrade to “sell” with a lower TP of RM6.17 after cutting projections. Our TP is derived based on higher price-earnings ratio (P/E) multiple of 24 times FY20 earnings per share (EPS), in line with peers."

The group also attributed the lower profitability to its product mix during the quarter, besides its continuous investment in research and development (R&D) activities, according to its exchange filing today.  Quarterly revenue contracted 34.6% to RM66.51 million, from RM101.77 million in the year-ago quarter, on lower customer demand for its automated board inspection (ABI) and machine vision system (MVS), its filing showed.  This brings ViTrox's nine-month (9MFY19) net profit to RM61.86 million, down 18.6% against RM76.04 million in the corresponding period last year."

VITROX,Philip ( buy what you understand),4186 posts,2019-02-27 16:36:00,"Hmmm, results not flat leh. They did extra 10 million revenue this quarter. But their profit margin is consistent. I think not bad la.  But I don't understand the industry well enough to know if vitrox profit margins and growth is because they really have something special going on, or if their performance is due to artificial support from government tax free pioneer status. (Ends in a few years anyway)  I suspect ( not sure) if someone goes to them during the AGM and ask a direct question, if they lose the Pioneer status today, will they be competitive tomorrow, you may have an interesting answer.  I take the example of mikro MSc, a Sabah company and good friend of mine.  They were also enjoying 20+% profit margins on a very good niche product ( only protection relay and power meter manufacturer, designer and supplier in Malaysia), which they exported to Vietnam and Africa.  They enjoyed it until end of 2017, when their profit margins suddenly became very much affected due to Pioneer status lost, 24% income tax being introduced (from0%), benefits from duty import and levies all gone.  You can see what the net effect was on the stock and earnings.  Now I don't know if the same thing will happen to VITROX, as I'm not smart enough to judge how big the market is, how capable VITROX is at competing with international market, or even what their basic competitive advantage is, ( Location? Quality? Price? Reputation? R&D?) What is so special about VITROX anyway versus the Korean competitor? What's the extra secret sauce?  As far as I can tell, what VITROX has is nothing the industry has not seen before, except that they sell it much cheaper. Their production times are quite long for a machine, and it's quite new in the market so won't know the reliability of it but it seems quite popular especially in USA.  Problem is I don't see it in big wins like supplying to big company like intel, tsmc, lg, etc etc which can be used as a marketing tool.  I don't know if income tax will effect it or not in the future, but time will tell.  Good luck all."

VITROX,newbie8080,2072 posts,2018-09-21 14:46:00,"@ witan   Every stock pick is different. Different industry has different PE average. Besides that, even within the same industry, each company has different products and target market. Moreover, some companies has competitive edge and some has better profit margin. All this will be factored into the PE.  If you do not prefer Vitrox due to high PE which is unjustified, you may choose other counters. I do agree that the current PE is quite high but notice that the company revenue(eg:Quarter2) grows more than 30% than previous quarter in 2017.  So may want to use forward PE instead rolling 4 quarters PE(current PE) Then the PE would be much less.  Just my 2 cents."

Kelington rides on semiconductor upcycle  One stock in the value chain that has also been riding the semiconductor growth wave is Kelington Group Bhd – a company that provides ultra-high purity (UHP) gas delivery solutions for the electronics and semiconductor industry.  Gas delivery systems are used to safely reduce gas pressure from higher pressure cylinders to supply process tools and various instruments in a semiconductor facility.  Besides UHP, Kelington is also involved in process engineering (PE). About two years ago, it ventured into the industrial and specialty gases business, a segment its management believes could morph into a solid earnings driver going forward."

He says the company will focus on executing these jobs and recognition of progress billings will contribute positively to its financial performance in 2021, which kicked off to a good start with net profit rising more than one-third year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM5.54mil in the first quarter (Q1).

Such is the experience with integrated engineering solutions provider  Kelington Group Bhd given many of its project orders are coming from repeat customers.  Most recently, its wholly-owned subsidiary Kelington Technologies Sdn Bhd has secured a  RM50 mil contract under its process engineering division from  Stolthaven (Westport) Sdn Bhd, a reputable global provider of high quality storage and distribution services for chemicals, clean petroleum products, gas vegetable oils, biofuels and oleochemicals.  Kelington will be undertaking the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) works related to the oil products storage tanks for the Tank Pit 8 Expansion Project located in Port Klang (Selangor).  Having commenced on July 14, the project is slated for completion by October 2022.  Raymond Gan Hung Keng (CEO - KGB /0151)  Inclusive of this new contract win, Kelington has so far clinched approximately  RM195 mil of new orders in 2021 which lifted its outstanding orderbook to  RM454 millions as of July 2021.  “We are delighted to be given the opportunity to be a part of our repeat customer’s expansion plans for its terminal facilities,” commented Kelington’s CEO Raymond Gan Hung Keng.  “The group has been working with this customer since 2018 and having to support its growth journey has been fruitful for us.”  Gan said the trust that Kelington received from its repeat customers is a testament to the company’s diverse engineering capabilities and discipline in adhering to the highest compliance standards.  “We have also been receiving a surge in tender invites from our existing and new customers from across our key operating markets which includes Malaysia as businesses are resuming its expansion activities that were put on hold last year,” he pointed out.  “This is a good indicator for us – and should the momentum sustain – we hope to achieve another all-time high order book. With an acceleration in the global vaccination programme, we hope to see an improved operating landscape across our key operating markets.”  At 4.02pm, Kelington was up 1 sen or 0.86% to RM1.17 with 5.28 million shares traded, thus valuing the company at RM755 mil. – July 15, 2021  ========================================================================= Profile of  Stolt - Nielsen Limited in the world   Stolt-Nielsen Limited (SNL) is a leading provider of integrated transportation, storage and distribution services through its three largest operating units: Stolt Tankers, Stolthaven Terminals and Stolt Tank Containers.

KGB,dghvms88,30 posts,2021-07-21 18:09:00,Maybe syndicate or EPF sell down to 1.13. Maybe operator wooing EPF to stay in KGB. Good credibility for KGB. EPF has lost a lot in Serba. So EPF have to make back the lost funds so they have one of the stable company like KGB. So now operator may give a finishing touch for EPF by sweetening the mother share thus the warrant gets the lift up. Very sweet

In the FY20, the group secured an all-time high order of RM490mil with SMIC continuing to award more jobs.    Existing SMIC jobs at hand are expected to keep the group busy until June, excluding on-going 2021 tenders.    ""We came away from a conference call with the management feeling pumped-up over the group’s prospects.    ""With increased expansions among wafer fab players taking place this year due to a surge in demand for semiconductor components, we believe that FY21 could yet be another record year, building upon the existing all-time high order of RM490m secured in FY20,"" said Kenanga.    It said Kelington as the incumbent has the advantage in winning the 2021 tenders, which will consist of UHP holl-up in all four SMIC fabs.    The group has also secured sub-contract jobs from TSMC via a partner as well as Micron, which is looking to expand due to the global memory shortage.    Kelington's tender book currently stands at RM900mil, spread equally across Malaysia, Singapore and China.    ""Being regarded as a preferred vendor among large MNCs, the group is in a favourable position to benefit from various on-going expansions by the likes of WD Penang (announced RM2.3b investment), Micron SG (new fab construction), and Lam Research,"" the research house added.    Meanwhile, Kelington's LCO2 plant is expected to be halal-certified in a month's time, which will further increase demand as the group penetrates the food and beverage industry.    The plant utilisation has recently increased to 100% from 50% due to strong orders from Singapore, leading to higher average selling prices.    Kelington's operations in all 17 sites in Malaysia are on-going despite the movement control order as it has received approval as an essential service.    Kenanga maintained ""outperform"" on the counter while raising its target price, before bonus  to RM3.10 from RM2.30  based on a higher FY21 forecast price-earnings ratio of 32x.

As a beginner my point of view is, does it has something to do with the upcoming election or political changes? (we all know stock market is always ahead).  Because with bonus issue, warrants, and dividend this is truly a real company that is making real money and has a real business why would major shareholders disposed now?  KLSE has been very bad and it is not the worst. Those who are short term investors in this counter if I'm you and need money, I would cash out now.

KGB,Nepo,1932 posts,2021-07-06 08:55:00,"Requote:_  KELINGTON GROUP: (KGRB MK, CP: MYR2.11, Not Rated) Bonus issue and free warrants Maybank IB Retail Research (7 April 2021)  Kelington proposed to undertake: 1) a 1-for-1 bonus share issue; 2) a 1-for-3 bonus warrant issue; and 3) a diversification into the manufacturing, distribution and trading of industrial and specialty gases. Note that its Board intends to implement the proposed warrants issue after the completion of the bonus share issue. The proposed exercises are expected to be completed by 3Q of 2021.  Based on yesterday’s closing price of MYR2.11, the theoretical ex-bonus price is MYR1.055. Meanwhile, the 5-year warrant is theoretically worth MYR0.57 apiece, based on an indicative exercise price of MYR0.975 per warrant. One, however, should take note that it is the intention of the Board to fix the exercise price of the warrants on a premium of up to 30% to the ex-bonus price.  Although the warrants will not raise any funds when issued, Kelington could raise up to MYR209.7m at the indicative exercise price of MYR0.975 per warrant, assuming all warrants are exercised, which will be used to part finance the acquisition of assets for the industrial gas business, to meet its general working capital requirements and to partially repay borrowings.  The latest corporate exercises not only reward its existing shareholders but also to strengthen its balance sheet. Note that Kelington is sitting on a net cash of just MYR73.4m at end-Dec 2020 vs. its current outstanding order book stood at about MYR358m. Notwithstanding that, Kelington’s outstanding shares could balloon by about 167% on a fully diluted basis.  In spite of the EPS dilution in the immediate term (due to bonus share issue), it should not affect brokers’ rating. Currently, research houses are positively biased on Kelington with three Buys and one Hold, with a mean target price of MYR2.24. This is likely premised on its growth prospects. At present, the street is forecasting a 21.6% 3-year EPS CAGR for FY20-23. Valuation wise, the stock is trading at 25.4x consensus FY21 EPS of 8.3sen, above its 3-year historical average P/E of 18x."

KGB,collie,203 posts,2021-06-28 15:24:00,Currently there's no more catalyst. Usually it will surge on announcement of BI ex date then expect profit taking. Since the rejection at 2.28 already got signs that big money exiting ady and true enough aberdeen took some profit. But anyways KLCI is down and full of bad sentiment. If got slight profit I would take otherwise it will test your holding power if KLCI don't recover quick enough.
KGB,SHQuah,4823 posts,2021-06-28 15:33:00,Why don't want free warrants ? Even if you sell now do you think you can buy back cheaper. Free warrants is like Ang Pow.
KGB,collie,203 posts,2021-06-28 16:02:00,"Free warrants still some time to go. This upcoming ex date is for BI. If the counter is on an uptrend sure i will keep and get the BI but if its sideways trend I tend to take profit after the surge because of the uncertainty in how the market reacts. With that said, the KLCI is down so almost all counters are affected (i hope you all are looking at the big picture). If a bear market is looming surely some people will plan an exit strategy and get some profit first especially those that joined the train recently and bought at higher prices. So unless you hold a very cheap ticket then it's better to retrieve your bullets to fire when the bull returns."

Because with bonus issue, warrants, and dividend this is truly a real company that is making real money and has a real business why would major shareholders disposed now?   KLSE has been very bad and it is not the worst. Those who are short term investors in this counter if I'm you and need money, I would cash out now. Don't last minute then only decide or change to be long term investor.   Just my 2 cents, feel free to correct me if my thoughts and views are wrong."

KGB,Nepo,1932 posts,2021-06-30 05:58:00,"It is normal for a cum bonus stock share price fall before ex bonus date (1 July 21) because traders or long-term holders will take profit due to ex-bonus uncertainty.  It is also common for long-term holders to sell some shares and take profit and buy back when the share price below certain level. I dont know what big brothers motive, but as long as the company operation still remain intact( the problem is we don't have info about this at the moment), nothing to worry.  To  me, you need to pay special attention once the company insiders begin to sell their shares..  From the current share price movement, it is really quite difficult to judge the share price after ex bonus date. Imho most probably will fall slightly if no special good news going to announce..  Hopefully very strong support at RM 1."

KGB,SHQuah,4823 posts,2021-06-15 12:45:00,Thanks.  Later got any updates on EGM ?
KGB,value investor,52 posts,2021-06-15 13:06:00,My side didnt take note of the EGM since only few question. But one interesting is shareholder asking why need to open EGM due to the company already run the industrial gas business. The answer is according to the regulation if the new business exceed 25% of the total revenue then the company need to approve by shareholder in the meeting. On the other hand means management think the industrial gas will reach 25% in this year so need to open for vote
KGB,value investor,52 posts,2021-06-15 13:12:00,I think if the result can ongoing like Q1 worst and Q4 better hybrid with the industrial gas margin. KGB having double turbo to boost their profit in this FY
KGB,value investor,52 posts,2021-06-15 13:13:00,this is what I predict only not management say

Inclusive of the carried forward projects from FY20 and new orders in FY21, our orderbook rose to RM459 million, out of which RM364 million remains outstanding.  KUALA LUMPUR (May 25): Kelington Group Bhd’s net profit increased 36.72% to RM5.54 million or 1.72 sen per share in the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 (1QFY21), from RM4.06 million or 1.3 sen per share a year earlier, on higher revenue.  Revenue rose 23.71% to RM104.82 million from RM84.73 million, driven by higher revenue recognition from the group's ultra high purity (UHP) and general contracting projects, which rose 9% and 220% respectively, the group said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.  The higher revenue was also attributed to a 73% growth in revenue at the group's industrial gases division, as demand for liquid carbon dioxide (LCO2) normalised on the back of resumption of economic activities."

We like KGB for its position as a UHP specialist, backed by multi-national clients such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), Infineon, Seagate, and Micron. Well positioned to leverage on the semiconductor industry super cycle following the recent expansion through the newly setup fabrication plant in China.  • Industrial gas expansion to generate long-term income stream. We are sanguine on the expansion of liquid carbon dioxide (LCO2) plant with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes pa that will generate long term income visibility. Utilisation rate may ramp up amid the improved demand as economic activities gather pace since 2H20.  • Record high orderbook to underpin earnings growth. After booking record high RM490.0m of orderbook replenishment in FY20, we have penciled an orderbook replenishment of RM450.0m each for FY21f and FY22f, supported by the uprising semi-conductor business cycle and higher demand for industrial gas. Moving forward, KGB’s outstanding orderbook of RM364.0m in 1QFY21 will sustain earnings visibility over the next 2 years."

KGB,Nepo,1932 posts,2021-05-10 08:14:00,"Extracted from FY 2020 Annual Report  KELINGTON GROUP BERHAD [Company No. 199901026486 (501386-P)] ANNUAL REPORT 2020  2021 OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS  After a year of muted growth, the global semiconductor industries are projected to resume its expansionary trajectory to address the explosive demand for integrated chips. The rising technological advancement in modern-day gadgets and vehicles are increasing the need for more chips and this has caused a global shortage leading to production disruptions across multiple industries.  The global semiconductor sales are projected to increase by 8.4% in 2021, driven by an ever increasing number of devices embedding semiconductor technology throughout the world, ranging from smartphones and tablets, automotive electronics, cloud computing data centres, as well as optoelectronics such as photonics and fibre optics. Global semiconductor players are ramping up its capacities and capabilities to race against the rising demand. High capital expenditure spending is expected in Asian countries such as China, where it is racing to gain chip independence.  This augurs well for Kelington as every expansion in a wafer fabrication facility requires UHP solutions, be it a new facility or an upgrade in equipment for existing fabrication facility. The Group will continue to ride on the booming growth and intensify our efforts to expand our clientele in China. We have made good progress in the first half of FY2021 and successfully clinched new milestone contracts worth approximately RM37.9 million to perform gas hook up works for Ruili Integrated Circuit Co. Ltd’s memory chip wafer fab project at Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, China. Ruili Integrated Circuit Co. Ltd is the parent company of ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc., China’s first independently developed memory chip maker. The new addition marks a breakthrough for Kelington as it represents the very first project win from the reputable state-owned semiconductor player. The pursue of this project is no easy feat, especially for a non-local player like Kelington, having to competewith renowned industry players from all around the world.  Recovery is also expected in the process engineering segment as non-electrical industries are back on track for growth. The Group is seeing a resurgence of expansion activities where multinational companies are investing to upgrade its facilities as well as build new plants. Two of our main markets, Malaysia and Singapore, are expected to have gradual recovery in economic activities while undergoing the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines programme.  The resumption in economic activities is also driving demand for LCO2. Our manufacturing facility is operating at an average of about 60% utilisation rate with some months reaching peak of 100% utilisation. The demand is coming from both the domestic and overseas market. The Group intends to expand our market segment to include end users such as food and beverage industries that consume larger amounts of LCO2 to produce carbonated drinks and frozen food. In conjunction with this expansion plan, the Group had obtained the Food Safety System Certification (FSSC 22000) particularly for food safety/ quality management system certification for its manufacturing, storage and distribution ofLCO2 activities for food and beverage industries in October 2020.  Our goal is to be a reputable regional player in the Industrial Gases segment. We will be accelerating our export activities by investing in transportation equipment and deploy more sales personnel to tender for contracts in the overseas markets, which includes Singapore, Taiwan and Indonesia. We have recently supplied two skid tanks of LCO2 to Taiwan for a pilot project and are delivering higher volume of supplies to Singapore via our in-house fleet of tankers. In addition to the LCO2 products, we aim to expand our product offerings within the Industrial Gases business, which include, but are not limited to, manufacturing and trading of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and hydrogen.  The start of 2021 has been encouraging thus far as our replenishment of orders in the engineering business remains robust with RM59 million new orders secured for works under the UHP segment for the China market . This has bolstered the Group’s outstanding orderbook to RM 465.9 million as at 31 March 2021, prior recognition of Q12021 revenue. Majority of the new orders secured were for works under the UHP segment for the China market. The Group’s tenderbook is at a healthy level with project bids worth RM900 million across China, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.  Coupled with the rising orders for our liquid carbon dioxide products, we are upbeat that FY2021 will be a remarkable year where Kelington will rebound strongly with greater growth."

The tremendous support from notable local and global institutional investors reflects their confidence in our strong track record and growth trajectory going forward.  CTOS Digital’s product offerings have expanded beyond credit reporting instruments to include a breadth of digital solutions to support every stage of the customer lifecycle.  All of this comes on the back of steady financial growth, making us the leading credit reporting agency in Malaysia.  To cater to the robust environment in Malaysia, we have steadily introduced new products each year, including CTOS eKYC, CTOS Consumer and SME Score, CTOS ID-Guard, the Malaysian banking industry’s first fraud bureau, and many more.  This is in line with our plan to introduce more digital solutions to ultimately build a dynamic, stable and agile financial ecosystem in Malaysia.  incidentally, there will be a 6 month lock in period ( moratorium) for cornerstone investors and also the major shareholder-Creador PE Fund."

CTOS,Goldberg,2244 posts,2021-07-19 20:03:00,"CTOS Digital garnered 23 cornerstone investors in its book-building exercise, with renowned names such as Employees Provident Fund Board, Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Aberdeen Standard Investment, AIA, Eastspring Investments, FIL Investment Management and JP Morgan Asset Management.  CTOS group chief executive officer Dennis Martin said the company will focus on providing more innovative digital solutions across the entire lifecycle of financial institutions, companies, and small  and medium enterprises, as well as supporting individuals on their own financial literacy.  “We will also continue to grow our product offerings and customer reach by expanding organically and through acquisitions within the ASEAN region. We believe that the IPO proceeds raised, coupled by our strong financials, will help us achieve our ambitions.  “While growing our track record, we remain committed [to] finding the right balance between reinvesting our profits for sustainable growth and generating shareholders’ returns,” he said in a statement.  CTOS targets a payout ratio of 60% of profit after tax and minority interests (PATAMI) for each financial year on a consolidated basis after taking into account working capital, maintenance capital and committed capital requirements of the group."

CTOS,Goldberg,2244 posts,2021-07-19 10:53:00,"Fair Valuation by UOB & Kenanga ---------------------------------  1- UOB Kay Hian Malaysia Research had a fair value of RM1.32 for the shares.  The research house said CTOS is well-positioned to prosper in the Asean credit bureau ecosystem, riding on its diversified customer portfolio, dominant market share with extensive database (more than 30 years) and ambitious regional growth strategy across multiple markets.  The large unbanked population and prospective credit growth in under-penetrated emerging countries where CTOS serves also offers plenty of opportunities for supercharged earnings growth.   2- Kenanga Research has initiated coverage on CTOS Digital Bhd on expectation that the credit reporting agency stands to benefit from a growing customer base and expansion of product offerings in an underpenetrated market.  The research house said it believes CTOS deserves a greater premium over its IPO price of RM1.10 per share, which represents a valuation of FY22 price-earnings of 35.5x versus about 31x of its regional peers'.  It pinned a fair value of RM1.40 to the counter, pegged to FY22E 45x PER."

But when some of thier vendors asking my partners how  much that they should sell thier share that they got from the company for  thier payment,  I think that can already conclude our doubts.

It 's same principles as how some developers paying to thier sub-Con - by barter system with  some of the houses. How do they declare that to income tax, it's the same principle as this.  I guess you never done business before."
CTOS,iHunter,613 posts,2021-07-19 08:00:00,"As I said, it's normal for Companies to pay to thier vendors by share. Some of my companies get our payment in that way and no issue.

CTOS,iHunter,613 posts,2021-07-19 08:09:00,"Normally, vendors will be offered 10% lower than its IPO value. So, if they sell it 9% lower, they still get thier payment."

CTOS,paperplane,21467 posts,2021-07-19 08:21:00,The IPO is to pay debts.
CTOS,iHunter,613 posts,2021-07-19 08:22:00,"The rationale is simple, they able retain thier cash instead of giving out the cash. Same rationale as developers paying to thier subcontractors - converting one of the house as payment. Subcontractors normally agree because they will be offered lower price than its retail price.  But to get the payment, they need to get agents to sell the houses. Same to IPO, the vendors need to sell it to get thier payment.   That is why  first trade of IPO will drop because employees and vendors want to get thier money ASAP."

CTOS,jeffchan1901,587 posts,2021-07-17 11:46:00,I feel this counter will be slow and steady to go up. My personal opinion is that will be up ard RM1.50-1.60 possible but only at Q4. However my remisier thinks otherwise that should not keep more than 2 weeks partly due to political and C19 scare.   What do you guys think?

JAKS,Sslee,6759 posts,2021-07-01 11:06:00,"Send below email to Jaks IR this morning: Dear JAKS IR,  First and foremost please allow me to congratulate the Board for a well conducted AGM.  I am glad that most of my questions submitted in advance were answered during the AGM but some were not. May I know the reasons for my following questions were not answered?  Group A  Question 2: External Auditor please explain your auditing and verification procedures in assessing impairment loss on trade receivables: RM 25,862,099 and other receivables: RM 45,331,965?  Question 4: BOD, is any impairment loss on goodwill and receivables were the result of disposal of 51% JIC to ICD for consideration of RM1.00?  Question 5: BOD, allowance for impairment of trade receivables: RM 25,862,099 and other receivable RM 45,331,965: Please provide the names of debtors, amounts owed, reasons for the debts and any specific action taken to recover the debts.   Group B  Question 1: BOD, please explain why receivables from former related company (RM 35,539,792 + RM39,669,110), jointly controlled by Directors of a subsidiary company (RM 5,329,038) and non-controlling interest of certain subsidiary companies (RM 12,730,481) are  unsecured and interest free?  Question 2: BOD, please explain how to make sure these unsecured and interest free receivables due from a former related company, jointly controlled by Directors of a subsidiary company and non-controlling interest of certain subsidiary companies will not end up as impairment loss in the future?   In addition I had keyed in additional questions during the live AGM using tiih online question box but do not know why these questions were not shown and answered? I presume it was due to technical problems hence do you mind forward the following question to the INED for their answer?  Please allow me to remind the Board: An independent, non-executive director being an outsider not involved in the day-to-day management of the company is the best-suited person to act as a watchdog to ensure that the company is functioning objectively in the best interests of the shareholders. It's the responsibility of the independent director to hold the management accountable in case of any suspected mismanagement within a company.  Question 1: INED may I ask, JIC “Pacific Star” project, Net liabilities RM (174,733,667) due to Liquidated and Ascertained Damages payment for delay handover of properties to buyers. Had INED done a post mortem and held Management/Executive Directors answerable, accountable and responsible for the mismanagement of the project?  Question 2: Impairment loss on goodwill RM 52,000,000, Trade receivables: RM 25,862,090 and other receivables: RM 45,331,965. Has INED request external auditor to do a forensic audit to determine whether any fraud or gross negligence and failure to perform fiduciary duty by the Management and Executive Directors in overpaying assets/acquisitions and not taking proper legal action in recovering receivables?  Question 3: INED, JRB had without fail needed yearly fund raising exercise either thro’ RI or PP and with current proposed Private Placement of up to 552,787,900 new ordinary shares in JRB, the NOSH will cross over 2billion+. Is the Management and Executive Directors acting objectively in the best interests of the shareholders with repeat RI and PP?  Question 4: I will vote against resolution 11 and 12 because I do not wish INED beholder to any Executive Director or Management and hence lose their independence and impartiality. Will INED please request the Board to withdraw Resolution 11 and 12 in order to protect your independent and impartiality as INED?   Thank you  Best Regards"

Was the amount deliberated and approved in a prior AGM?  The differences between the market prices and ESOS prices at the point of issuance are viewed as ‘perquisites’ under Section 13(1)(a) of the income tax. Act (ITA) in 1967 and are taxable. And since the ESOS prices are effectively zero, the entire amount of ESOS issued and calculated at the market prices upon issuance will be taxable.  If the directors failed to declare those perquisites, the compounds, fines, etc may well exceed RM20M. Not sure if there's still finder-fees of 20% for IRB whistle-blower...

The 30% profit amounted to RM 29.8 million is in relation to the share of profit from the sale of electricity to the EVN generated from the Hai Duong power plant. Capacity Charge contributes a significant portion of the payment. (Unit 1 for entire 3 months period while unit 2 is for only 2 months) Based on the above, you can extrapolate the yearly estimate profit contribute from JHDP)  Barring any unforeseen circumstances and subject to the profits and cash reserves available for the distribution, we are anticipating the dividend payout to be in mid 2022"

JAKS,firehawk,3800 posts,2021-06-18 21:50:00,"Posted by firehawk > Jul 23, 2020 11:39 PM | Report Abuse X  Agree that 30% profit is only acct entry, until dividend is paid. And paying dividend needs the Chinese partner nod, when will it be realized?  But now, JAKS is in severe cash /working capital constrain. It can be observed when the issuer fixed the issuing price at a unbelievable low @0.225, this ""forced"" the shareholders to subscribe, otherwise will face huge disadvantage! Revised of RI is very rare, but JAKS did it within 2 months. Is it so compelling?  This suspicion was confirmed when a director converted the WB to ordinary shares.  The director is the proxy of big boss. If he acts for himself, would he converted the WB to mother shares? He sell the WB, he can directly get 51sen. He exercises the conversion the pay 64sen and get back 81sen, an earning of 17 sen only (not including the WB cost, otherwise would be a loss). Why should he performs conversion?  The conversion has only one purpose, to inject cash to the company! (This is not something new, as far as I know, although very rare, some companies did this.) The company is the clear beneficial of the conversion! Converted 4m WB, injected 2.56m to the company account! May be now u realized why the same director always selling his holding! His act as a proxy of same purpose .......  Many have to be thought of .... the further deconcentration of share holding (this is no good), the 421m of debt, the waiting period of Viet power stations really pay dividend to JAKS ..... how long the time to pass the tunnel before seeing the light?

I am not surprised if JAKS cash strapped now since no cash flow till Vietnam PP dividend received. Market forces will decide JAKS share price. Assuming the Vietnam PP profit is real at RM160m per annum. The risk to the down side is limited at current price. I noticed the short seller has ceased short selling below 0.55?

While i am still unsure to call ALP a crook or not, i believe the verdict is obvious on Serba? Today SD came up to refute The Edge news and claimed that Block 7 is an Abu Dhabi company.

But the construction of the powerplant really happened and it was completely built.   ALP and his management really took effort and time to clinch this deal with Viet gov and strike a partnership deal with China. None of these are scams.  Now, the company has delivered the powerplant on time, it's time to build up cashflows to sustain it's operations. Coincidentally, Covid came and of course it didn't help but it's not a show-stopper. Private placement is fine during stages like these and the fact there are investors willing to put money shows trust and credibility in the company."

The first unit of the Hai Duong Thermal Power Plant has commenced operation on 24 November      2020 while the second unit had commenced operation in January 2021. 2. The power plant’s concession is owned by a 30:70 JV company (JAKS Hai Duong Power      Company Limited) with China Power Engineering Consulting Group Co Ltd (CPECC), comprises      of two 600MW coal-fire thermal units with a project cost of US$1.87bn. 3. Under the 25-year power purchase agreement, JAKS Hai Duong will be guaranteed with fixed      capacity payments by the Government of Vietnam and will be backed by energy payment to      cover variable costs, including fuel and variable operating costs, and therefore contributing to a      sustainable income contribution during the 25 years tenure. 4. Based on management’s guidance, the 2x600MW power plant will provide a revenue of      US$600m per annum. Assuming a 18% net margin and RM4/USD conversion rate, 30% JV will      generate net income of RM130m per year for JAKS. 5. In the recent quarter results, JAKS registered a PATMI of RM19.7m for 1QFY21 against a net      loss of RM6.2m YoY mainly contributed by the Vietnam power plant. We expect earnings to be      stronger in coming quarters reflecting the full contribution from Vietnam. Going forward, JAKS      will continue to expand its business in the power and energy sector in Malaysia and Vietnam. 6. We expect JAKS to register core net profit of RM94.6m and RM96.9m for FY21 and FY22      respectively. BUY with a target price of RM0.80 based on SOP (sum of parts) valuations,      implying PER of 15.0x and 14.6x for FY21 and FY22 respectively.  Source : Rakuten Research"

That's exactly what you thought last year when you sold out your Jaks shares just before the massive RI. What price did you sell at? Must have been around 0.80, right? What's the price now? Let me tell you & all the other moaners & groaners.  Today's closing price is equivalent to 1.37 pre-RI, after adjustment for the rights subscription & today's closing price for WC!! That's more than 50% gain from when you sold out because you thought that the RI was a bad idea!  And you are thinking the same thing again? If it is such a bad idea, why not leave it to those who have a different idea to invest in this share?

If you are serious investor and not a hit and run trader should you be concerned?
JAKS,mantua39,48 posts,2021-05-31 22:16:00,"Raising funds is part & parcel of every growing business. Jaks is no different as it has increasing requirements to fund new projects such as the LSS4 but has present insufficient income generating projects at the moment.  However, long-term investors like me can see that this situation will be resolved once JHDP starts distributing dividends from the power plant operations, as it surely will. Are you doubting that this will happen in due course. If you are, kindly explain why you think so & back that opinion with facts, not cast unwarranted aspersions like some other loud-mouths & empty bins in this public forum (who I will not bother to address).   PS. The quantum of my share gains or losses is irrelevant to this discussion. Nothing personal & no offence meant."
JAKS,Windy1974,443 posts,2021-05-31 23:17:00,"Below were the 5 scenarios i presented in Nov 2020. Looking at the latest JAKS pp, JAKS need working capital. That would make up 25% of the pp. Indeed, even with the Vietnam PP, JAKS management need to let share holders know when the dividend could be monetised in Malaysia. Otherwise, JAKS will constantly need working capital cos their Malaysia operation is bleeding. As i highlighted, if i were running JAKS, i would sell Malaysia properties even at a loss and stop construction jobs. However, now definitely not the best time to sell any properties cos it's the lowest you will get. So, i can only hope the 25% for working capital is not worse case scenario. However, at best it's 4th scenario. The working capital would come to around 5% of JAKS market cap. Another RM50 is for LSS solar farm. I am ok with it. So, all in all, 10% pp will be sufficient. The other 10% of the PP only could be raised if JAKS has an acquisition.  LSS should fall into scenario 2. As for the acquisition, can't comment which scenario it would fall under since nothing being annouced. I presume JAKS can't raise more than 10% without any acquisition news. As for the acquisition, if it's from middle east, i will sell first and verify later PS. you can read the details of pp utilisation under page 3 of the announcement.   Stock: [JAKS]: JAKS RESOURCES BHD   Nov 19, 2020 5:08 PM | Report Abuse   SSlee. I agreed with you RI won't benefit existing share holders due to dilution. The best scenario is not to have RI but bank loan. Best scenario. Company gets a bank loan for additional income generating business where the return would be higher than the loan interest. However, it needs to be a sure win business. In real life, where can find such business easily? 2nd best scenario. Company RI for additional income generating business. Best la if it's sure profit. 3rd best scenario. Company RI for additional funds into new business but profit or loss yet to determine 4th not so good scenario. Company RI for cash flow caused losing money but management still genuinely wanna make money Worst case scenario. Company RI for cash flow so that they could syphon more money away via salaries, expenses and loss making ventures. Normally these companies are easily identified in KLSE because they would do RI every alternate years and come up with very ambitious projections that never materialise. Now, JAKS is which one. You decide. I HOPE it's 2nd best la. How about Insas, SSLee? Which you reckon?"

JAKS,Windy1974,443 posts,2021-06-01 08:59:00,"Make sense. Insas is indeed deeply under valued. However, i won't buy Insas as one forumer once highlighted. ""opportunity cost"" Since i have limited fund, i need to decide on my best returns. Of course, i only ""hope"" i invested in the right company. Investing in deep discounted NTA companies was a strategy i employed more than 20 plus years ago. My experience told me that success rate low. Reason being that most deeply discounted NTA companies are deeply discounted for a reason. A lot of time, the major share holders are no longer active. This is just a general overview. The best scenario one could look for is the major share holder privatise the company like in the case of Cycle and Carriage. However, even in such cases, most offer price will be either ""fair but unreasonable"" or ""unreasonable"" at best.  Sslee Insas cash call RI Is not a cash call per se.

But the construction of the powerplant really happened and it was completely built.   ALP and his management really took effort and time to clinch this deal with Viet gov and strike a partnership deal with China. None of these are scams.  Now, the company has delivered the powerplant on time, it's time to build up cashflows to sustain it's operations. Coincidentally, Covid came and of course it didn't help but it's not a show-stopper. Private placement is fine during stages like these and the fact there are investors willing to put money shows trust and credibility in the company."

SCOPE,LohNewbie,47 posts,2021-07-07 18:34:00,"SCOPE INDUSTRIES - Major Turnaround Banking on Billion Dollar Supply Chain Diversion and Massive Capacity Expansion Author: The Alpha Seeker    |    Publish date: Wed, 7 Jul 2021, 5:22 PM  INVESTMENT THESIS:  1. Despite the Biden administration coming into power early this year, the stance on the US-China trade war has continued to intensify with no signs of easing between both parties (having most tariffs during Trump's tenure still in place), in fact escalating to other issues over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and human rights. With US still being one of the largest customers for many MNCs, this has led to many companies with production facilities in China to move its supply chain away into other parts of the world, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia to avoid US tariffs on Chinese imports.   [Published by SCMP on July 2021]  One such company is Taiwan-listed ODM player Inventec Corp (a major supplier of many consumer electronics, including Apple AirPods), which announced its plans to shift its assembly business away from China to Taiwan, Malaysia and Mexico. Given the huge impact of the tariffs, potentially affecting as high as 90% of its USD 18 billion business, this necessitates a large proportion of its production capacity to move out of China, creating massive opportunities for supply chains in other regions.   [Highlighted by Inventec CEO, David Ho in Taipei Times on November 2018]  In Malaysia's case, Scope Industries is one of the many companies who has greatly benefitted from China's manufacturing exodus. They specialise in PCB assembly and has also recently expanded into completed electrical and electronic product assembly, including complete box-build products. On April 2019, Inventec has emerged as a substantial shareholder through its smart device manufacturing arm Inventec Appliances Corp, holding ~5% stake in the Company. Prior to Inventec's entry, Scope's revenue and profit has been on a steep decline for 2 consecutive years, resulting in the Company suffering few quarters of losses. Fast forward to FY2020, Scope experienced a 26% increase in its top-line, as a result of a 675% spike in sales from Taiwan from RM 1.1 million to RM 8.7 million, which we deduce to be contributed by Inventec (""Customer A"").    Subsequently in the following three quarters of FY2021, its revenue growth continue to accelerate despite the Covid-19 pandemic, achieving its highest ever quarterly revenue of RM 11 million, RM 14 million and RM 21 million accordingly, with a YTD gross margin of 18% and returning to profitability with a net margin of 10%.    We believe orders from Inventec will continue to grow exponentially as we are just in the beginning of its production shift. Sonos, whose products are made by Inventec, has also expressed it wanted ALL of its US-bound products to be from Southeast Asia by the fall of this year, implying further opportunities for Scope to secure new orders.   [Published by WSJ on May 2021]  2. At the same time, Scope is aggresively expanding its production capacity from 145,200 sq ft of floor space to 299,200 sq ft on a 2.5 acres land in Parit Buntar, Perak, in anticipation of heightened demand coming from its existing customers and potential new customers arising from the US-China trade war, providing further fuel for its top and bottom-line to grow tremendously.   [Highlighted in 2020 Annual Report]  3. In order to fund this expansion and future acquistions, Scope has announced a 2-for-1 rights issue at a ~32% discount to TERP on March 2021, which could raise a minimum of RM 14 million and a maximum of RM 67 million upon full subscription. What's compelling is the fact that Inventec has bought all rights issue shares from the 2 major shareholders to boost its stake to ~10% (upon minimum scenario) or ~7% (upon maximum scenario). We believe this move by Inventec is truly a win-win situation for investors, as it signals a deeper commitment into Scope as both a long-term business partner and also customer, abating some of the concentration risk of Inventec, having accounted for ~40% of its FY2020 revenue. Despite the rights issue being dilutive to investors, we believe the potential profit stemming from its new incoming capacity will be highly value accretive to investors in the coming years.  4. Looking at its growth trajectory going forward, we estimate Scope to deliver a minimum of ~RM 100 million in revenue and ~RM 10 million in net profit for FY2022, implying an undemanding forward PE of 30x, which we opine to be grossly undervalued and believe it is worth at least 50 sen/share in the near term, and RM 1/share in the long term as earnings visibility kicks in."

SCOPE,hakubasnow,232 posts,2021-07-05 11:36:00,"118400 x 0.175 = RM 20,720 that the amount you need to pay to subscribe to the rights. Last month I bought 100,000 Saudee-OR @ 0.005 with a total cost of RM 15,500 after subscribing for the rights. I was sure that I'm going to lose my money when the price of Saudee kept dropping to 0.14 and the rights was undersubscribed. But in the end I made a profit of RM4000+ after selling the rights  and the warrants. Could have made much more if I hold a bit longer.   My point is, if you got the money just subscribe to the right issue and see how it pans out. I didn't buy Scope-OR as I feel that the right price was a bit high for me @ 0.175.

If SPRM found mahb corrupted by bp healthcare, myeg if later also get mahb covid swab test then confirm king and queen both corrupted. If myeg not announcing also corrupted mahb, then could mahb insider rumor be true? The officer No1 in mahb. Who could that be? If not the king, who else could have reported the affair of bp healthcare and mahb? We all though myeg and bp healthcare married to buy out officer No1? How come only bp healthcare announced?  If really true many of myeg businesses are corrupted, what make this mahb different? it's just part of myeg culture. Which Malaysia company doesn't corrupt? As long mahb still dreaming to do covid swab as a business and myeg is part of it, SPRM will not let go. Even if myeg can keep buying SPRM staff to work for myeg, mahb itself is under huge investigation.   Myeg is smart to cut string with bp healthcare and mahb, even totally stay away from the mess. Sooner or later SPRM will go into MOH if MOH is involved with bp healthcare and mahb.  So the answer is NO, myeg not yet corrupt mahb. They will, but not at the junction. Else mahb would have announced already."

Why MAHB so scared i3 investor questioning and exposing potential corruption of bp healthcare in Malaysia? MYEG also named but the news did not show MYEG name, so MYEG hide news if they also got appointed by MAHB to do covid test or really not a part of it?   This bp healthcare is MYEG partner correct? Why MYEG did not announce news if they also involved? Investors are in the dark.   Funny thing is why MAHB so scared link to Tan Sri DG Noor Hisham, and this bp healthcare put DG face in front page https://airport.doctor2u.my  MYEG if partner with bp healthcare can also put Tan Sri DG face on MYEG web site? Kan sells better linking to Tan Sri DG right? Bp healthcare can do linking DG to sales profit, MYEG also can do help share price up 2.00.   Also did Kementerian Kesihatan or DG approved MAHB and bp healthcare giving covid test the national crisis duty to make personal profit? If can make profit why KKM don't just make themselves, why let a company make profit? KKM though MYEG already helping KKM why need MAHB and bp healthcare some more?   Still curious. MAHB if nothing fishy why afraid Malaysian ask questions check and balance? If KKM approved such thing why did not announce to all Malaysian? If not approved how MAHB can simply pakat bp healthcare and announce public to confuse Malaysian for a covid19 national crisis duty to become a ""business"" news?   Most big question for all investors. Why MYEG did not disclose this news if they are part of the MAHB and bp healthcare taking over KKM covid test business?"

MYEG,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-07-11 00:39:00,马股下半年拨云见日 4大投资主题值得关注 2021年07月10日 下半年投资策略 （吉隆坡9日讯）尽管当前乌云密布，但随着本地疫苗接种加速，分析员认为，马股市场应会在下半年恢复元气，并点名股息、科技、商品和复苏主题的投资策略。  大华继显研究分析员在今日发布报告指出，群体免疫的乐观情绪，相信能消除政局不稳的忧虑；昨日富时隆综指挫跌1.4%，因为巫统宣布撤销对国盟的支持，引发投资者担忧。  “不过，我们认为市场在很大程度上，已消化了政治风险。更重要的是，未来潜在新政府采取的政策方向，也不太可能与国盟当前方针有太大偏差。”  因此，随着我国疫苗接种加速，焦点会重新转向经济重开的主题，分析员估计市场将从第三季中期开始复苏。  虽然马股市场复苏不均衡，但预计末季仍会持续复苏，归功于广泛市场赢家所引领。  “在末季达到群体免疫的目标，将令我国在明年可重开边境。”  同时，分析员列出年底综指1635点目标，等同本益比16.2倍，符合历史均值。  分析员还列出了下半年重要正面事件，包括本地封锁松绑，希望可在第三季底开放跨州、云顶（GENTING，3182，主板消费股）户外主题公园开张、特定种植股和商品股迎来异常强劲盈利季度，及年底实现群体免疫。  不过，关键风险则是下月单日卖空禁令将解除，及手套均价进一步潜在走低。  大华继显研究选股 综指明年底料冲1775点  放眼明年，当我国经济重开，并顺利展开复苏的前提下，分析员估计综指有显著上行空间。  “假设盈利增长1到2%，且估值恢复到疫前的16.9倍水平，综指明年底有望触及1775点。”  投资主题选股 近期催化剂不清晰  配合上述展望，分析员列出了4大投资主题，包括价值和高股息投资、科技股（受惠于需求增长、贸易转移及全球5G科技推出）、经济重开，及特定商品超级周期主题。  因此，分析员建议增持有价值的银行股、高股息的产托股、复苏主题的博彩股等、电子与制造业的特定出口股，及商品为主的特定提炼和种植股。  报告补充，分析员大型股首选为联昌国际（CIMB，1023，主板金融股）、云顶大马（GENM，4715，主板消费股）、益纳利美昌（INARI，0166 ，主板科技股）和MyEG（MYEG，0138，主板科技股）。  同时，还有齐力（PMETAL，8869，主板工业股）、双威（SUNWAY，5211，主板工业股）、马电讯（TM，4863，主板电信与媒体股）和云升控股（YINSON，7293，主板能源股）。  中型股首选合成种植（HSPLANT，5138，主板种植股）和腾达科技（PENTA，7160，主板科技股）；环境、社会与监管（ESG）股项首选为亚通、联昌国际、益纳利美昌、MyEG、双威和云升控股。  “不过，在近期市场催化剂不清晰之际，即冠病确诊病例高居不下，投资者最初只会青睐价值/股息和科技增长股。”  手套建筑料跑输大市  至于手套和建筑股，分析员相信下半年仍会跑输大市；这两大股项在今年上半年已显著跑输综指。  “在需求放缓和全球供应强劲增长情况下，手套商应该仍会因均价下跌而表现逊色。”  建筑股方面，虽然受益于房产销售显著恢复，但大型项目加速推进的希望渺茫，将令本就承受打击的建筑股表现不佳。

MYEG,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-06-26 00:39:00,相关成本待定。同时，正式分发疫苗前，需获得国家药剂监管机构（NPRA）的批准。  “公司有信心，疫苗获准在国内分发后，将加速推动我国走向全民免疫。”  周五闭市，MYEG收报1.82令吉，无起落，交易量约为843万股。
MYEG,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-06-26 00:55:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- My E.G. Services Bhd has signed a letter of intent (LOI) to purchase 10 million doses of Anhui Zhifei Biopharmaceutical Co Ltd’s COVID-19 vaccine, ensuring that the corresponding quantity of its recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August.  In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, MYEG said it holds three-year rights to exclusively distribute the vaccine in Malaysia while through a separate partnership, the group has two-year exclusive distribution rights to the vaccine in the Philippines and is presently in discussions to distribute in other countries.  ""Last week, MYEG announced plans for the roll-out of a vaccination programme in the Philippines that will cover the provision of the vaccines to the public health segment as well as private sales,” it said.  The LOI is to ensure that the corresponding quantity of Zhifei’s recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August when vaccination through the private market is enabled.  ""This paves the way for the vaccine to be imported and made available to Malaysians as soon as the private market commences and subject to the conditional authorisation of the vaccine by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA),” it said.  The cost of the vaccine will be determined later subject to the conditional authorisation by NPRA.  MYEG said it is confident that when the Zhifei vaccine becomes available locally, it can play an important role in accelerating the country’s drive towards achieving herd immunity against the COVID-19 virus.  Jointly developed by Zhifei and the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the vaccine has fast emerged as among the preferred vaccines in China since gaining emergency use authorisation there in early March in view of its distinct inherent advantages as a recombinant protein subunit vaccine. More than 60 million doses have already been administered in more than a dozen provincial-level regions, including Beijing. The vaccine is also being used in Uzbekistan.  Recombinant protein technology is proven, having been used for the development of vaccines such as hepatitis B and shingles.  In addition, recombinant protein vaccines can be more easily produced at a large-scale since production does not need to be carried out in high-grade biosafety laboratories, and they are also more cost-effective and easier to store and transport.  Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, MYEG has leveraged its strengths and expertise as a leading digital services provider in the region to introduce a number of significant initiatives as part of a holistic solution aimed at helping in the fight against the pandemic.  Besides vaccines, these offerings include screening services, quarantine management and digital health travel pass systems."

FA - What sort of FA analysis is this? Where's the talk about DCA? CAGR? NTA? Nett cash? What the flying f*** talking about JPJ contract alone? Where is the mention of the overseas project? The bonus issue? MCO leading to more online transactions over at its portal? EPF buying? Why no mentions of all these things together? Still bulls**t article.  You wanna speculate, fine. Don't write an article talking as if you are neutral positioned when its not. Don't think that you could get away with just putting a '?' in your subject then you are pro.  On top of that, the grammars all does not make sense and its confusing. Icing on the cake, use a new dupe account to post? Looking at the name both katak, are you related defending him/her?   Jeez, 'What if he is right?' Even if he is right then so what? Did anyone of us casted doubt on his prophecy/prediction? Bruh, its about the one of the worst nonsense here. If he's confident with his prophecy/prediction let alone calling it analysis. Then please, show yourself, use your real identity. Don't hide behind a keyboard writing all nonsense 'analysis' when you can't even use your identity conveying something you are 'confident' about. If any, the lack of validity in terms of their credit only further strengthens the argument that he/she is just bulls**ting.  Whereas for you, same principal can be applied. If the article is posted in a public forum, then its made available for people to scrutinize and criticise. Why double standard on 'Why so bad reaction? Cannot give human right different comment? If all rubbish why bother?'; He/she wanna post, why can't I give BAD reaction? What a lame argument for you.  A BAD article deserves a BAD reaction. Don't publish if you can't write well, you only make a fool of yourself. Don't publish if you can't take the heat. Scoot off and get good."

MYEG,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-06-01 21:19:00,"Date: 01/06/2021  Source	 : 	MACQUARIE GROUP Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) maintained an Outperform rating on My E.G. Services (MYEG) following its strong 1Q21 revenue and profit, mainly contributed by the health screening tests and motorcycle road tax renewals. MQ research believes these will continue to record higher volumes with the rising Covid-19 cases and the reintroduction of total lockdown which takes effect today. MQ Research’s target price for MYEG is RM2.42, 25.4% higher than yesterday’s closing price of RM1.93.  Good results driven by testing volume and road tax renewals MQ Research reiterates an Outperform recommendation on MYEG following 1Q21 results. 1Q21 profit came in at RM76mn, 26%/23% of MQ Research/street’s expectations. 1Q21 revenue/profit grew strongly at 41%/30% YoY due to an increase in Covid-19 health screening tests and higher-than-expected motorcycle road tax renewals, mitigating the decline from lower immigration services, i.e. permit renewals and job matching. Its online grocery service, BELI, was an added driver, as MYEG processed ~RM1mn in sales per month in 1Q21. MQ Research sees a 16% 20-24E profit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) providing upside to MYEG’s 19x 22E enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA).  What MQ Research liked.  In-line with MQ Research’s expectations, MQ Research expects Covid-19 testing volume to contribute positively to MYEG’s 1Q21 results from the pent-up demand of migrant workers’ testing. MQ Research believes that testing rate momentum is still high in 2Q21 as Malaysia is undergoing intensive testing amidst rising infection cases and a full lockdown reintroduction. The full lockdown should boost online road tax renewals for both motorcycles and cars based on what MQ Research saw last year.  What MQ Research didn’t like.  The pivot towards Covid-related services, which is a lower margin business compared to its e-government services business for road transports or immigration services, is evident from lower profit margins seen this quarter.  What’s interesting.  Recently, MYEG announced more initiatives related to its healthcare segment by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with Breathonix to introduce a rapid breath test system for Covid-19 screening in Malaysia. The same test has been approved in Singapore. While commercial details are scarce, MQ Research believe the estimated launch price for the test is ~RM60. MYEG will need to get the necessary approvals from the Ministry of Health to launch it in Malaysia. 12-month Target Price Methodology MYEG MK: RM2.42 based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology"

MYEG,Atan311,6 posts,2021-06-03 11:38:00,"BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A three-shot recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine developed in China is now available in Beijing.  The vaccine (CHO Cells) was jointly developed by the Institute of Microbiology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Researchers from the institute have been receiving their first jabs in Beijing's Haidian District since Thursday.  China authorized the emergency use of the vaccine on March 10, and people from many provinces including Anhui and Hubei have since received the vaccine. On May 3, the first batch of the vaccine was rolled off the production line in Beijing, according to the institute.  The results of phase two trials, which involved people aged between 18 and 59, show that 83 percent of participants produced neutralizing antibodies after two doses of the vaccine, and 97 percent produced neutralizing antibodies after three doses.  The early-stage trials, conducted among people aged 60 and above, show that the seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibodies reached 95 percent after three doses, with no serious adverse reactions related to vaccination.  The level of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccine is comparable to other recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA vaccines globally, the institute said in a statement.  Recombinant protein vaccines do not need to be produced in high-grade biosafety laboratories, and large-scale production can be quickly achieved. They are more cost-efficient and easier to store and transport, said the vaccine maker.  Dai Lianpan, a member of the vaccine development team and a researcher at the institute, said recombinant vaccine technology is mature and has been used for vaccines for several diseases such as hepatitis B and shingles.  The recommended interval between vaccine doses is one month.  ""Two doses can produce neutralizing antibody levels slightly lower than those of recovered patients, but three doses will double the levels and produce a more lasting immune effect,"" said Dai, adding that the recombinant vaccine can induce stronger immune responses.  Researchers have tested the COVID-19 vaccine against a variant first detected in South Africa and found that the immune effect decreased slightly but antibody levels remained mostly effective."
MYEG,Atan311,6 posts,2021-06-03 11:40:00,"(Global Times) -China continues to expand and accelerate nationwide inoculation with the launch of the country's first three-dose COVID-19 vaccine, which experts said would provide extra protection than the one-dose and two-dose candidates. The three-shot vaccine is already being administered in at least 13 provincial-level regions in China.   The three-dose COVID-19 vaccine was jointly developed by the Institute of Microbiology of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical. It is China's first, as well as the world's first recombinant subunit protein vaccine and it has already been approved by Chinese national authority, according to the website of the CAS microbiology institute.  Since being approved in China on March 10, the vaccine has been administered in at least 13 provincial-level regions in China, including East China's Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, Southwest China's Guizhou, Central China's Hubei and Henan provinces, as well as in Beijing, according to the institute's website and media reports  The company is expected to produce more than 500 million shots of the vaccine by the end of this year, the People's Daily reported on May 22.  Before approving the Zhifei Longcom vaccine, China had approved two-dose inactivated and one-dose recombinant adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines.   Compared with the others, the three-dose vaccine can provide more protection as its third dose can serve as a booster shot to enhance immunity, Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert, told Global Times on Sunday.  There have been signs that inoculated people will probably need a booster in the future. As China has put the epidemic under good control, it is unlikely that the country would provide booster shots to people in the near future. So people living in areas without epidemic can choose the Zhifei Longcom vaccine to get stronger protection although it may take a longer time to finish the procedure, Tao said.   According to the company website, it is better to administer the second and third shots of the Zhifei Longcom vaccine 28 and 56 days after the first injection.    As all five vaccines approved in the Chinese mainland are being rolled out on a more widespread scale, more people are rushing to get vaccinated given the recent cases of infections. China has continued to set records in its daily and overall vaccination numbers."

Your literature alone is enough to trigger me let alone your poor analysis be it TA or FA.  FA = Use PE ratio when you mention its ""oligopoly"". If its indeed 'Oligopoly' like you mentioned, you might as well point out how come JPJ license got renewed? If it doesn't get renewed, how would it impact the earnings? How much impact? EPS? CAGR affected? What would be the discounted cash flow without these projects?  TA = Use Head & Shoulder << ????????? WTF ????? Who trades using 1 indicator alone?  Okay I have to stop here, its really giving me a cancer reading this try hard article even when I don't own MYEG shares. You lost your credibility when you use words such as ""Bubble / Technically Pump up"" with your ""analysis"".  Amateur."

Services Bhd (“MYEG”) announced today that it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Singapore’s Breathonix Pte. Ltd., paving the way for the pioneering introduction of a rapid breath test system for the screening of the COVID-19 virus in Malaysia. Breathonix has developed a real-time breath test system for the qualitative detection of volatile organic compounds that are unique to COVID-19 in human breath specimens. Compared with Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (“RT-PCR”), which is costly and time-consuming, Breathonix’s breath test system is a non-invasive, accurate and affordable solution that can generate results within a minute, making it particularly suitable for mass screening in high-traffic locations."

Developed by Breathonix — a spin-off from the National University of Singapore (NUS) — the BreFence Go Covid Breath Test System is the first breath analysis system to receive provisional authorisation here, NUS and Breathonix announced on Monday (May 24).   Breathonix is working with the Ministry of Health to run a deployment trial at Tuas Checkpoint, which is set to start in a few days.  Incoming travellers will undergo the breath test, which will be done alongside a compulsory Covid-19 antigen rapid test, the university and Breathonix said in a statement.  Responding to TODAY’s queries, Breathonix said that the cost of each test ranges from S$5 to S$20, depending on the quantity of tests done.  Unlike standard Covid-19 tests that entail inserting a swab into a person’s nose or mouth, Breathonix’s breath test requires an individual only to blow into a disposable valve mouthpiece.  The exhaled breath is collected, measured and analysed for volatile organic compounds, which are produced by various biochemical reactions in human cells.  Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/60-second-covid-breath-test-hsas..."

Rubin told the panel that without eliminating the virus, even a vaccinated population could “collapse under the next variant.”  “An infectious carrier of the delta variant will infect his family even when they are fully vaccinated. If you live with a child who is a delta carrier, he will infect the parents,” he said, adding that Israel was seeing serious cases and hospitalizations even in fully vaccinated patients."

KOSSAN,NatsukoMishima,430 posts,2021-07-23 14:09:00,【新冠肺炎】抗疫到“关键时刻”　美又现“超级真菌”致3死  （华盛顿23日讯）美国疾病预防和控制中心(CDC)主任瓦伦斯基，当地时间周四再次对美国当前疫情发出紧急呼吁，警告称美国尚未完全脱离疫情。另一方面，美国出现“超级真菌”传播事件，已造成3人死亡。  中新网报导，瓦伦斯基表示，印度变种病毒Delta是科学家见过的最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。  她强调，Delta比之前的（新冠肺炎）毒株更具侵略性和传染性。 “这是我们目前所知的、也是我从业20年以来所见的，最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。”   Delta目前正在全美迅速传播，截至本周，在已测序的病例中，感染该变种病毒的病例已经占到总数的83%；而在7月初，这个数字还只有50%。  瓦伦斯基还对全美疫情发出警告，称Delta正在低疫苗接种率地区广泛传播，这是美国又一个抗疫的“关键时刻”。  瓦伦斯基恳请尚未接种疫苗的人“严肃对待Delta ”。她强调，“这种病毒不会自动放弃，它会不断搜寻脆弱的人并感染他们。请考虑接种疫苗，并在此前注意防疫”。  《纽约时报》指出，这与白宫数周前的态度形成鲜明对比。独立日期间，美国总统拜登在白宫南草坪举行盛大派对，宣布美国“从疫情中独立了”。  报导称，瓦伦斯基最新的表态显示，官方越来越担心已经取得的成就正在丧失，当前激增的病例可能让那些疫苗普及率低、住院率高的地方卫生系统不堪重负。  3类主要药物无效  另一方面，美国卫生官员周四表示，现在有证据表明，一种“无法治愈”的真菌在两家医院和一家疗养院内传播，已造成3人死亡。  根据美国疾控中心的报告，华盛顿特区的一家疗养院和得州达拉斯地区的两家医院爆发“超级真菌”感染。少数患者患有侵袭性真菌感染，3类主要药物对这些感染都是无效的。  美国疾控中心的博士莱曼称，“这确实是我们第一次开始看到耐药性聚集病例”，其中患者显然是在相互感染。  多年来，卫生官员在发现一些常用药物对真菌感染情况几乎无效后，就一直对这种超级真菌的可能出现发出警告。  2019年，医生在纽约诊断出3起病例，这些病例也对一类称作为棘白菌素的药物具有抗药性，该药物被认为是对抗真菌感染的最后一道防线；但在纽约的病例中，没有证据表明感染已在患者之间传播。科学家得出结论是，治疗过程中形成了对药物的耐药性。  不过，美国疾控中心对于最新出现的病例得出结论，这些真菌感染确实进行了传播。  在华盛顿特区，一家专门收治重病患者的疗养院中出现101例感染耳念珠菌病例，其中3例对所有3种抗真菌药物均具有抗药性。达拉斯地区两家医院的感染集群有22人，其中两例具有这种抗药性。  根据美国疾控中心的说法，这些病例发生在2021年1月至4月。在治疗完全无效的5人中，有3人死亡，其中两人是得州的医院病患，另一人在华盛顿。  莱曼表示，两地的病例都在持续爆发，自4月以来还发现了其他感染。但新增病例尚未被报告。  调查人员查看了医疗记录，没有发现这些集群中的患者以前使用过抗真菌药的证据。卫生官员表示，这意味著它们会在人与人之间传播。

KOSSAN,AdCool,3152 posts,2021-07-07 19:21:00,"China wont have advantage for US and Europe markets as the Western are still having trade wars with China. Another challenge is the shipment. The freight rate has increased almost 10 times compare to a year ago due to shortage of containers. Shipment from China to Europe would take additional 2-3 weeks in comparison with Malaysia and 50% more expensive than from Malaysia. Hence, even if China can produce, the buyers would consider such factors of higher freight rate, longer shipment time and whether their clients are receptive to China made products - gloves. Bear in mind that Supermax and Top Glove have higher inventories and this could be good time to reduce their inventories since they have been producing more due to new production lines."

KUALA LUMPUR (July 14): The Government may need to impose a windfall tax on companies that recorded extraordinary profits during the Covid-19 pandemic, said former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.  According to him, the tax will enable the Government to increase its financial resources as well as help the people who are affected and increasingly squeezed by the Covid-19 pandemic.  “This windfall tax is not an unusual thing...this may help the Government because in this time of emergency and Covid-19 problem, we have to spend a lot because we need to help the poor, to give out extra income and we need to feed people who have no food.  “So all these need to be done and require money. But if we follow taxes normally, there will be less (economic) activities and the Government will also get less taxes,"" he said as a member of the forum panel entitled 'Can the Malaysian Economy be Saved?' which was posted on Facebook Reset Malaysia today.  Dr Mahathir said the Government was also advised to focus fully on fighting Covid-19 and restructure the distribution of allocations from non-essential items to more important items.  Asked whether the Government should reintroduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to increase the country's coffers, the former Prime Minister said introducing a new tax in the current situation would not alleviate the problems faced by the Government."

When countries open up, more people will return to work, play and travel.  When more peoples return to work, play and travel, demand for gloves will go up even more.  New normal dictates that gloves are not just for the medical/health sector alone.  Don't believe me?  I went to a bank yesterday and saw even some tellers were wearing gloves, not all of them though. It is not far fetched to suggest that very soon it could become company policy to supply gloves to all their front line staff.  Just imagine all the other sectors other than medical where people starts wearing gloves as a precaution for example aviation, f&b, cashiers, barbers, masseurs, beauticians etc etc. I can go on and on until tomorrow...  The more countries open up, the more the demand for gloves will be.  One more thing, even if the market crashes tomorrow, gloves will remain strong solely due to its extraordinary earnings for years to come.  Now tell me, are there other such counters in bursa other than gloves?  Please let me know if there are."

KOSSAN,L2,629 posts,2021-06-24 18:19:00,"Would it hazard to surmise that the incessantly relentless one-sided torps to deep sink the glove titans seem altogether a coordinated campaign to desensitise fundamentals, devalue positive metrics and steer technicals to render them irrelevant and drown the entrapped?  Some of the observed tactics were to firstly regress Spmx to 1.00 below TG, followed by continually depressing Koss to crack and delimit the floor for Spmx, along with precision-timed, nostradamus-level farsightedness albeit somewhat misguided debasing downgrades for the sole purpose to contain any potential reversal to the upside at every glimmer of hope, every silver lining, every opportunity.  Latest case in point : while Comfort's sterling noon results on 21jun boosted its price trajectory at the pm open, banded stranglers instantly waterfalled both Spmx and TG in equal coordinated flash to snuff out any catalysing effect from Comfy. Their pm intraday trajectories could not have been more obviously and desperately divergent. Complicitly, one IB busybodiedly decided to neuter Koss TP at the break just to enable Spmx's lockstep descent after 1430h without psychological constraint. Well-oiled mauling bear machine?

KOSSAN,Mr.Sm Invest123,1684 posts,2021-06-26 00:58:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- My E.G. Services Bhd has signed a letter of intent (LOI) to purchase 10 million doses of Anhui Zhifei Biopharmaceutical Co Ltd’s COVID-19 vaccine, ensuring that the corresponding quantity of its recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August.  In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, MYEG said it holds three-year rights to exclusively distribute the vaccine in Malaysia while through a separate partnership, the group has two-year exclusive distribution rights to the vaccine in the Philippines and is presently in discussions to distribute in other countries.  ""Last week, MYEG announced plans for the roll-out of a vaccination programme in the Philippines that will cover the provision of the vaccines to the public health segment as well as private sales,” it said.  The LOI is to ensure that the corresponding quantity of Zhifei’s recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August when vaccination through the private market is enabled.  ""This paves the way for the vaccine to be imported and made available to Malaysians as soon as the private market commences and subject to the conditional authorisation of the vaccine by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA),” it said.  The cost of the vaccine will be determined later subject to the conditional authorisation by NPRA.  MYEG said it is confident that when the Zhifei vaccine becomes available locally, it can play an important role in accelerating the country’s drive towards achieving herd immunity against the COVID-19 virus.  Jointly developed by Zhifei and the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the vaccine has fast emerged as among the preferred vaccines in China since gaining emergency use authorisation there in early March in view of its distinct inherent advantages as a recombinant protein subunit vaccine. More than 60 million doses have already been administered in more than a dozen provincial-level regions, including Beijing. The vaccine is also being used in Uzbekistan.  Recombinant protein technology is proven, having been used for the development of vaccines such as hepatitis B and shingles.  In addition, recombinant protein vaccines can be more easily produced at a large-scale since production does not need to be carried out in high-grade biosafety laboratories, and they are also more cost-effective and easier to store and transport.  Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, MYEG has leveraged its strengths and expertise as a leading digital services provider in the region to introduce a number of significant initiatives as part of a holistic solution aimed at helping in the fight against the pandemic.  Besides vaccines, these offerings include screening services, quarantine management and digital health travel pass systems."

KOSSAN,Will76,574 posts,2021-06-21 12:32:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (June 21): PublicInvest Research has downgraded the rubber glove sector to ""neutral"" as it expects average selling prices (ASPs) for the sector to decline gradually in the second half of the year (2H21), following the improving Covid-19 situation in both the largest glove consuming markets, the US and the European Union (EU).  Its analyst Chua Siu Li in a note today cut her earnings forecasts for the sector by 10% to 35% on the back of lower ASP assumptions.  According to her, the improving Covid-19 situations in the US and EU resulted in much lesser urgency for distributors to immediately replenish inventories back to usual levels of two to three months.  “The buyers are adopting a more careful stance currently to avoid locking in purchases at high prices.  “We expect ASPs of gloves to start trending lower in the second half, supported by the improved Covid-19 situation as well as lower raw material prices as tight supply of nitrile butadiene latex continues to ease and [with a] better yield for latex concentrate after the end of the wintering season in May,” she said.  She also noted that glove makers’ commitment to stepping up on their social compliance practices will also translate into higher costs going forward, and she reckoned that it would take time for glove makers to fully pass on the cost increase to buyers, so it should result in margin compression in the near term.  Chua downgraded her rating of Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd to ""neutral"", with a lower target price (TP) of RM3.65.  “We cut our FY21 to FY23 earnings forecasts for Kossan by 37% to 51% to account for the expected decline in ASPs,” she said.  She also maintained her ""neutral"" call on Top Glove Corp Bhd but lowered her TP to RM4.40."

The Malaysian firm, which is already listed in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, flagged in late April it would sell 793.5 million shares in the listing, half what the company proposed in its application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in February.  However, the deal has stalled as the company awaits indications from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on whether an imports ban would be lifted any time soon, the sources said.  Top Glove did not respond to a request for comment. The sources could not be named as the information was not yet made public. 01/06/2021 1:32 PM X Last hope for glove counter also demolished by the news of hk ipo ! Afternoon waterfall !"

KOSSAN,Will76,574 posts,2021-06-09 22:52:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (June 9): Top Glove Corp Bhd expects average selling prices (ASPs) of gloves to drop further in the coming month due to weaker demand from the US and lower raw material costs.  Its executive director Lim Cheong Guan noted that the ASP of nitrile gloves fell 20% in Top Glove's third financial quarter ended May 31, 2021 (3QFY21).  ""The ASP adjustment was in line with market pricing trends and lesser sales volume to the US,"" he told a virtual press conference held in conjunction with the announcement of the group's latest quarterly results.   Lim expects lower nitrile latex prices as costs of the raw materials, namely butadiene and acrylonitrile, are expected to decline by 10% and 6% respectively between May and August.  ""A lower natural rubber latex concentrate price is expected in the coming months as the wintering season ended in May 2021, and yields are expected to improve,"" he added.  The world's largest glove manufacturer posted a softer quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) performance for 3QFY21.  Its net profit fell 29.03% to RM2.03 billion from RM2.87 billion for 2QFY21, while revenue shrank 22.42% to RM4.16 billion from RM5.37 billion, as the group was barred from exporting to the US.  The group said the weaker q-o-q performance was owing to a decline in ASPs by 16%, a lower sales quantity following a temporary halt in shipments to the US from Malaysia and higher latex as well as natural rubber latex concentrate prices.  On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, the group’s quarterly net profit jumped almost five times to RM2.04 billion from RM347.9 million a year earlier on a higher revenue.  Revenue climbed to RM4.16 billion for 3QFY21 from RM1.69 billion previously.  Despite the weaker earnings performance, Top Glove declared a dividend of 18 sen a share, including a special dividend of 5.3 sen.  Top Glove gained six sen to close at RM4.84 today, with a market capitalisation of RM39.72 billion. It saw 34.54 million shares traded."

Malaysian firms, which includes some of the world's biggest palm oil and rubber glove producers, have faced increasing scrutiny in recent years over reports of labour abuses.  Employment and Social Development Canada told Reuters in an email that its Labour Programme was ""actively researching a number of forced labour allegations in different countries and sectors, including palm oil and glove manufacturing in Malaysia"".

KOSSAN,Albukhary,2210 posts,2021-05-29 00:42:00,"Why public invest in Glove Stock when Full Lock Down?  1) When Government implement full lockdown, most of the business will be affected, and more than 70% of the Bursa listed company will be affected as well, especially those recovery stock. When they are affected, investor will foresee their coming quarter result will be bad. Hence, many investor will pull out their fund from these recovery stock. As a share investor, when you sell 1 stock, you seldom will take out the money and save into bank, you will immediately buy another stock which has less / minimal impact from the full lock down. So Health care sector is one of their first choice, as healthcare business are essential business, they can continue to operate during full lock down.  2) As you can see, most of the western country are start opening up their border, and all industries are back to normal. After this pandemic, people awareness on health have increase, many industries that previously never use glove has start to use glove regularly, such as massage, facial, saloon, food preparing...etc. This is so call the new normal after pandemic. I remember I have study a report last year, the journal foresee the demand of glove will surge when all economy sector start to open. Now it is a good timing for glove sector in Malaysia, when all other industries lock down, raw material will become cheaper, shipment to export will be ease also, worker shortage can be solved also (as previously many factory are paying high salary to grab worker, especially those contract worker with low skill required, such as packaging)"

Americans need to start getting used to seeing people outside without masks as more and more people get vaccinated against Covid-19, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday.  Fauci reiterated new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said fully vaccinated people didn’t need to wear masks in public, unless they were in a crowd.  “We got to make that transition,” Fauci said in an interview with CBS News after anchor Gayle King said people give her “the side-eye” when she takes her mask off outside, even though she’s fully vaccinated. “If you are vaccinated and you are outside, put aside your mask, you don’t have to wear it.”  There is debate among medical experts over how much outdoor transmission is driving cases.  “The top line result of all studies included in the systematic review said less than 10% of cases are transmitted outdoors,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday at a Senate hearing.  Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, blasted Walensky during the hearing, saying the agency’s “conflicting, confusing guidelines ... undermined public confidence and contradicts the scientific guidance of many experts.”  A report by the New York Times cites epidemiologists that say the CDC number is misleading, and that the actual number of outdoor transmissions could actually be below 0.1%.

The vaccine, one of two main Chinese shots that collectively have already been given to hundreds of millions of people in China and abroad, becomes the first COVID-19 shot developed by a non-Western country to win the WHO's backing.  It is also the first time the WHO has given emergency use approval to any Chinese vaccine for any infectious disease.  A WHO emergency listing is a signal to national regulators on a product's safety and efficacy, and would allow the shot to be included in COVAX, the global programme to provide vaccines mainly for poor countries.  ""This afternoon, WHO gave emergency use listing to Sinopharm Beijing's COVID-19 vaccine, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO validation for safety, efficacy and quality,"" the UN health agency's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference.  Tedros also said that a separate expert panel has recommended two doses of Sinopharm vaccine for those aged 18 and above.   The WHO has previously given emergency approval to COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and, last week, Moderna.  The decision to approve Sinopharm's vaccine was taken by WHO's technical advisory group, which began meeting on Apr 26 to review the latest clinical data as well as Sinopharm's manufacturing practices.  A separate group of WHO experts, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), voiced concern this week over data provided by Sinopharm on the risk of serious side-effects in some patients, but was confident in the vaccine's ability to prevent disease, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.  SAGE found an efficacy of 78.1 per cent after two doses in multi-country Phase III clinical trials, according to the document. The vaccine's developer, Beijing Biological Products Institute, a unit of Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group, had announced an efficacy of 79.34 per cent.  The WHO has said it could reach a decision on China's other main COVID-19 vaccine, made by Sinovac Biotech, as soon as next week. The technical experts reviewed it on Wednesday.  China has deployed around 65 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine and more than 200 million doses of the Sinovac shot. Both have been exported to many countries, particularly in Latin America, Asia and Africa, many of which have had difficulty securing supplies of vaccines developed in the West.   ## https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid-19-sinopharm-who-emerg..."

KOSSAN,Keyman188,4890 posts,2021-05-10 09:06:00,"China-produced vaccines await approval by EU and WHO, will be 'major boon to the world'  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has started a rolling review of China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, the EU's top drug regulator announced Tuesday, and experts said that once the vaccine is approved, China will further fulfill its international responsibilities as a major power and provide support to the international community in the pandemic fight.   Sinovac and another China-produced COVID-19 jab, Sinopharm, are also under WHO assessment for emergency use, and results are anticipated in a week.  The EMA said the decision on whether Sinovac can be marketed in Europe will be based on preliminary results from laboratory and clinical studies.   According to the EMA, a rolling review is to speed up the assessment of a promising medicine during a public health emergency, allowing data to be reviewed as they become available from ongoing studies. A specific timeframe for the review is not provided, but the EMA said the process should ""take less time than normal.""  Sources at Sinovac told the Global Times on Wednesday that since there are many COVID-19 vaccines awaiting EMA approval, the process is not expected to be completed soon. The previous four vaccines took two to three months to be approved after rolling reviews began.  The agency has ongoing rolling reviews of three other vaccines, Sputnik, CureVac and Novavax.  The EMA has previously approved four COVID-19 vaccines, developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen. If approved, the Sinovac vaccine will be the first non-Western COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in the EU.  In April, Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine received a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate from Hungarian authorities, the first Chinese COVID-19 vaccine to receive such a certificate from an EU country and a step forward for Chinese vaccines to become a global public good.   Vaccine experts pointed out that the issuance greatly enhances the competitiveness of China-produced vaccines in Europe and the confidence of smaller European countries in Chinese vaccines given the uneven distribution of vaccines in Europe.   ""With reference to this certificate, it is also more likely that the EMA will approve the Chinese vaccine market license more quickly,"" Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert told the Global Times on Wednesday.   Sinovac and Sinopharm are also under WHO assessment for emergency use, and the results are anticipated in early May.   Cont...   ## https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1222712.shtml"

They can just invest in new plants, machineries, lands, technologies, or even acquire other strategic assets without the need to loan from banks. They also can pay off their existing loans and debts to the financial institution and saved on interests. Could also develop new channels such as own distribution networks / own brand, etc. The actual valuation of the company should be 3-5 years from now after the pandemic and how the management actually invest their new found wealth. That would differentiate them from the peers and leapfrog the company to another level. Top Glove is already investing into better accommodation and automation. Supermax is opening up new plants in Northern America and focusing on the new biz of lens and masks. If the company just purely invest in opening new plants in Malaysia, that would be shortsighted. They should think deeper on the whole supply chain and how to gain from it with their hoard of cash now."

AT,Tansri777,333 posts,2021-07-21 16:29:00,"Surge in demand for gloves to lift value of rubber product exports to RM74 billion this year 18 JUL 2021 / 20:56 H. Surge in demand for gloves to lift value of rubber product exports to RM74 billion this year Rubber gloves are likely constitute over 90% of Malaysia’s total export of rubber products. – BERNAMAPIX GEORGE TOWN: The value of Malaysia’s rubber product exports is estimated to increase by 80% to reach RM74 billion this year from RM41 billion last year, attributed to a spike in shipments of rubber gloves.  Rubber gloves are likely constitute over 90% of the country’s total export of rubber products, said a Malaysian Rubber Board spokesperson.  “The improving global economic activities have scaled up the outlook for natural rubber (NR) demand. Global consumption of NR is anticipated to increase 6.7% to 13.7 million tonnes in 2021 following the 7.8% fall in 2020.  “The consumption in major markets like China and the United States has shown a positive increase due to resumption of business operations following the vaccines rollout to combat the Covid-19 pandemic,” he told Bernama in an email interview.  However, he said the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, which led to movement restrictions and lockdown, minimisation of workforce and other control measures imposed by the government, would cause disruptions in the NR supply chain.  Meanwhile, he said Malaysia’s NR exports are expected to rise by about 5% to RM6.5 billion compared with RM6.2 billion in 2020, mainly supported by good rubber prices in 2021 over 2020.  He added that rubber production this year is projected to increase to 530,000 tonnes from 514,700 tonnes in 2020, which was the lowest in a decade."

GEORGE TOWN: Malaysia’s export of rubber products is estimated to increase by 80 per cent to reach RM74 billion this year from RM41 billion last year, attributed to a spike in the export of rubber gloves.  Rubber gloves would likely constitute over 90 per cent of the country’s total export of rubber products, said a Malaysian Rubber Board spokesperson.   ""The improving global economic activities have scaled-up the outlook for natural rubber (NR) demand. Global consumption of NR is anticipated to increase 6.7 per cent to 13.7 million tonnes in 2021 following the 7.8 per cent fall in 2020.  ""The consumption in major markets like China and the United States has shown a positive increase due to resumption of business operations following the vaccines rollout to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he told Bernama in an email interview.  However, he said the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, which led to movement restrictions and lockdown, minimisation of workforce and other various control measures imposed by the government would cause disruptions in the NR supply chain.   Meanwhile, he said Malaysia’s NR export is expected to rise by about 5.0 per cent to RM6.5 billion compared with RM6.2 billion in 2020, mainly supported by good rubber price in 2021 over 2020.  In terms of rubber production trend this year, he said it is projected to increase to 530,000 tonnes this year from 514,700 tonnes in 2020, which was the lowest in a decade. - Bernama"

AT,Tansri777,333 posts,2021-07-08 20:04:00,"Selangor Lockdown Disrupting Global Medical Glove Supply: Manufacturers By CodeBlue | 8 July 2021 French healthcare and medical glove distributor Euromedis SA says Malaysia must perform its obligations to France and to the world to ensure adequate supply of medical gloves to the hospitals.   Dr Supramaniam Shanmugam, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA). Picture courtesy of MARGMA. KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 – In an immediate response to queries and the flood of messages from embassies, hospitals and health care sectors from across the world, Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) president Dr Supramaniam Shanmugam has acknowledged the concern and apprehension of all, and has vowed to seek a quick solution to the impasse, whereby the Malaysian government has imposed a total lockdown in the state of Selangor.  The state hosts the largest congregation of medical rubber glove manufacturers, and combined, they produce about 58 per cent of the world’s medical examination and sterilised surgical gloves.   Since last Saturday, all medical glove manufacturers in Selangor have been instructed to cease production under the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO). This took the industry by surprise, since medical gloves have been an essential personal protective equipment (PPE) item for frontline health care workers.    Thus, it is understandable why such a sudden instruction to shut down the industry has caused no small amount of consternation.   The importance of medical gloves is evidenced in the fact that when a child is born, the first thing that he or she touches is a pair of gloves, and it will most probably be made in Malaysia. Our nation supplies about 67 per cent of total glove consumption globally.  The World Health Organization (WHO) and the global health care industry have recognised medical gloves as PPE for infection control. Dr Supramaniam has questioned how such an important PPE item be not classified as an essential item.  “It is incomprehensible, as surgery and the examination of patients in critical cases cannot be done without donning a pair of protective medical gloves. It is in the health care SOPs for sure. Health care workers must be protected in order to protect humanity,” said Dr Supramaniam.  MARGMA has been inundated with expressions of concerns from its global buyers.  A major French health care and medical glove distributor, Euromedis SA has expressed its concern about the shutdown.  “Malaysia must perform its obligations to France and to the world to ensure an adequate supply of medical gloves to hospitals. This sudden closure is sending a bad signal that Malaysia is not  capable in fulfilling its global supply as a leading medical glove producer. It is also about responsibility,” said Mathieu Roturier, Euromedis SA chairman and CEO.  Dr Supramaniam has pleaded with the Malaysian government to immediately reinstate the production of all medical glove manufacturers in Selangor.  “Notwithstanding the huge economic losses to the nation, we have a more important duty and responsibility to ensure that there is no disruption to this very essential medical item for the nation, as well as the 195 countries who depend on our supply pipeline. Remember that Malaysia is the undisputed world leader in this field, we have a duty to perform,” said Dr Supramaniam.   Meantime, MARGMA, in its engagements with the various ministries, has assured the authorities that it will supervise and monitor its members to practise the strictest compliance with all the SOPs as laid out by the MOH.  MARGMA has a special unit that will work with the MOH in managing and supervising manufacturers in Selangor. Its employees are also on the vaccination waiting list.  Likewise, MARGMA will ensure all the latest SOPs, as stipulated by the authorities, including PCR/RTK screenings twice a week, will be carried out accordingly."

That's the lowest closing on this year. That's show investors fund are pulling out. If they really want to invest, they will invest more fundamental glove counters instead of AT. Glove production is not the main biz for AT.  It's truth that AT are the cheapest shares on glove counters. But don't forget they are making losses business. Unless they showing a great balance book on incoming report at least another 2 QR. Else no one will interested to be genuine investor and only attract ppl to play pump & dump game."

AT,OldWiseMan100,190 posts,2021-07-03 10:39:00,"retailers do not know how to cut loss, that is the biggest problem. they buy shares based on the price, not the value of the company or the quality of the management.  they see 10 cents and say it is cheap, but say MBB  RM8 is expensive. in the end, if you going ot invest RM100K in both companies, 10 cent of RM8 makes no difference in the amount you going to invest. Many think 10 cent and easily go to 20 cents, can double up. or 90 cents can easily go to RM1, and can profit 10%...

Since then, the Group has further completed additional 3 production lines and is now running 6 glove dipping lines with an annual capacity of 0.88 billion pieces of gloves. The Group is currently building 4 production lines concurrently and scheduled for completion progressively between now and end of September/October 2021. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, upon completion of these additional 4 production lines, the Group will have a total 10 production lines with an annual capacity of 1.5 billion pieces of medical gloves.

Thus far, the Group has obtained the following certifications, licenses and qualifications: - • CE Marking Certification - typically recognised in the European region for the export of its medical examination gloves. • Establishment Registration with Food and Drug Administration of the United States (“FDA”), which allow the Group to export its medical gloves to the United States. • EN374 test standard: Protective gloves against chemicals and micro-organisms. • Medical Device Authority license which allows the Group to manufacture, distribute and sell our gloves locally. • ISO9001 & ISO13485 certifications. The Group is in the midst of applying 510(K) approval from FDA and target to obtain it by 2021. Capitalising the above certifications and qualifications, the Group expects strong demand for its gloves. The prospects remain generally good and the Group shall continue to work with strategic partners to lock in commitments for the purchase of gloves. The Group has also completed acquiring a piece of industrial land measuring 72,770 square meters located in Kamunting, Perak on 26 March 2021. Depending on the availability of funds from time to time, the Group intends to install up to 50 production lines in Kamunting.

Semalam pun PM8 mengakuinya dengan berkata bekalan oksigen kita kritikal walaupun dia masih cuba menyalahkan pentadbiran saya.   Isu oksigen ini sangat kritikal.   Tanpa oksigen ramai pesakit yang akan mengalami kemudaratan yang teruk termasuk kematian.  Langkah pertama untuk mengatasi masalah adalah dengan kita mengaku kita ada masalah.  Kes hari ini mencecah 17K. Bermakna penggunaan hospital dan fasiliti kesihatan termasuk oksigen akan semakin meningkat. Tidak ada tanda ia akan menurun.   Diharap kerajaan tidak melakukan kecuaian jenayah sekali lagi sebagaimana mereka membiarkan penggunaan ICU mencecah 104% sebelum melakukan tindakan.   Sekiranya kita tidak mampu lagi mengendalikan masalah ini, sudah tiba masanya kita meminta bantuan masyarakat antarabangsa kerana kita sememangnya dalam krisis yang sangat teruk.  Jumlah penduduk India sebanyak 1.37 bilion orang - 43 kali ganda lebih ramai berbanding Malaysia.  Keadaan Covid Malaysia sebenarnya sudah berkali ganda lebih teruk berbanding paras paling parah India pada bulan Mei lalu.  Masa itu, kerajaan India tak ego. Tak sombong.   Mereka mengaku sistem kesihatan sudah lumpuh, bekalan oksigen hospital tidak cukup dan meminta bantuan antarabangsa.  Hasilnya ialah lebih 17,500 unit Oxygen Concentrator, iaitu alat yang menghasilkan oksigen dari udara atmosfera, dihantar ke India oleh komuniti antarabangsa dalam masa beberapa hari sahaja. Tapi di Malaysia pula, kerajaan kita asyik kata kita belum gagal. Keadaan terkawal tapi realitinya ialah kita kekurangan oksigen sehingga ada tuduhan yang tidak dinafikan kerajaan PN bahawa puluhan orang mati lemas di hospital Ampang pada Hari Raya Haji akibat bekalan oksigen gagal. Tolong jangan nafikan keadaan ini.   Darah saya mendidih melihat jumlah kematian yang semakin membukit saban hari. Dan tolong!!! Saya tak mau dengar idea pelik-pelik seperti cetak duit, menghijaukan ward dengan membawa masuk tumbuh-tumbuhan untuk tambah oxigen dan seumpamanya..  Bukan masanya untuk anda jadi badut.

BIG,7chewe,203 posts,2021-07-24 16:12:00,"KUALA LUMPUR: Shares of BIG Industries Bhd extended its rally on Friday, surging to RM1.98 as punters continued to chase up the industrial gases producer.  At midday, it was trading at RM1.98, up 26 sen with 18.79 million shares done. It was a record high for the company, then known as Bintulu Industry Gas, before a one-into -0 share split in mid-2005.  Its market capitalisation rose to RM101mil based on the issued shares of 52.90 units.  On Thursday, its share price hit limit-up, surging 38 sen to RM1.65 – a record since 2005.  Punters on social media platforms had expected BIG to gain by supplying liquid oxygen due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. Whether their expectations come true is yet to be seen.  https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2021/07/23/big-gains..."

Bali, terkenal dengan pantai dan kuil-kuil pelancongannya, bersama dengan pulau utama Jawa dan 15 wilayah lainnya berada di bawah sekatan koronavirus yang ketat sehingga esok. Kerajaan sedang membahaskan sama ada sekatan itu akan dilanjutkan atau tidak.  “Kami mengalami kekurangan oksigen sejak 14 Julai lalu dan hari ini semakin kritikal kerana lonjakan kes baharu.   “Ada krisis oksigen di Bali,” kata Ketut Suarjaya, Ketua Badan Kesihatan Bali.  Indonesia, negara keempat terpadat di dunia, telah mengalami lebih daripada 3 juta kes jangkitan koronavirus dengan 80,598 kes kematian menurut data rasmi.  Kes-kes dicetuskan oleh varian Delta dan setakat ini tiada tanda-tanda kes akan reda.  Organisasi penyelidikan Our World in Data mengatakan Indonesia merekodkan kadar kematian tiga kali lebih tinggi daripada purata global.  Suarjaya berkata, pesakit di Bali memerlukan 113.3 tan oksigen pada hari Khamis, sementara hospital hanya memiliki 40.5 tan.  Kekurangan oksigen juga berlaku di Jawa dan kerajaan telah mula mengimport bekalan oksigen dari Amerika Syarikat dan China. – MalaysiaGazette --   Original Page: https://malaysiagazette.com/2021/07/24/bali-kekurangan-bekalan-oksigen..."

BIG,drken91,26 posts,2021-07-22 19:33:00,"I've been here since early July, you may scroll upwards to confirm.  HODL together with PakMan early on, average price 67cents, and I'm still holding.   I've said before, I'll say and kompang it again.   3 strong catalysts for BIG   1. Oxygen shortage supply   Yes, last QR profit was only 11K but if you read their year 2020 report - business was impacted during the full MCO and still their revenue was decent, mainly from gas production and liquid oxygen supply - their most notable client was Air Liquide last year. Google who is Air Liquide pls.   Now oxygen shortage supply is more evident, unlike last year's phase of pandemic.   Cases continue to hit ATH every week despite rampant vaccination and new variants keep emerging all over the world. Delta variant is no joke, guys.   CDC proclaims that its the pandemic of the unvaccinated.   2. Sarawak stock  Guys, if you worry about another black-swan political event, (M'sian style) don't worry, Sarawak is a king-maker in the political scene through the years. With BIG being in Bintulu, it will too benefit from the upcoming state election and SCORE project.   3. Sarawak highest vaccination rate in the country   No doubt Sarawak sped up their vaccination rate to accomodate the coming state election, but the positive side of it too is that S'wak will return back to normalcy first compared to the rest of the state and reopen the state's economy.   Happy Sarawak Day to the Sarawakians who are shareholders of BIG  Happy Huat Day to all investors / traders / HODLers of BIG   stay safe and take care  This is not a buy/sell call, I'm not a sifu but a see-LU. (LOL)  Sees limit up opportunities and share, lets kita jaga kita and huat together, regardless of whatever trading strategies you have for this gem : )"

What has happened during the review period? 1. Careplus has completed its private placement exercise; 2. Comfort has listed its free convertible warrants; 3. Rubberex has set its private placement price at 80 sen and is looking to place out its shares.  Now, Rubberex is the cheapest in terms of its share price. Even so, it is hardly trading at below 90 sen, way above its private placement price.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------	 John1234 Jun 21, 2021 10:18 AM   If you check back my previous posting on 6 May 21, I had mentioned that Rubberex, Comfort and Careplus were like 3 musketeers, trading at about the same prices:  Rubberex - RM 1.13 or 2.26(original pre-bonus issue price) Comfort - RM 2.24 Careplus - RM 2.23  Look at the prices now: Rubberex - RM 1.02 or 2.04(original pre-bonus price) Comfort - RM 2.08 Careplus - RM 1.74  So, we can see that Careplus has dropped the most during the corresponding period. Rubberex lags slightly behind Comfort currently.  Without doing homework, we cannot make a meaningful comparison."

I suspect it could be due to the dire need to preserve cash for its capacity expansion.

Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the remaining cases which make up 96.8 per cent are cases under the CAT-1 and CAT-2, or low-risk categories.  “There are 260 CAT-5 patients who are critical and in need of ventilators, 129 CAT-4 patients who need oxygen, 127 CAT-3 patients who have lung infection, 6,901 CAT-2 patients with mild symptoms while 8,485 patients have no symptoms,” he said in a statement today.  Malaysia registered a second consecutive day of record-high Covid-19 numbers today, surpassing yesterday’s unprecedented 15,573 cases.

RUBEREX,gemfinder,5437 posts,2021-07-25 10:03:00,"Dr. Jamalludin, however, said the vaccines had shown to be effective in protecting people from a severe form of the Covid-19 virus.  “Two doses of Comirnaty (Pfizer) and AstraZeneca can protect 88% and 60% respectively from the Delta variant, and it can prevent hospitalisation up to 96%,” he added.  As such, he said the vaccination rollout played a pivotal role in ensuring the Delta variant did not undermine recovery efforts.  “Our vaccine rollout now is among the best in Asia, if not in the world. More than 15% of the population have received two doses and it is important to fully vaccinate more than 50%.  “However, we may see its effect only later. Perhaps not in terms of the number of positive cases, but the number of hospital admissions and deaths,” he said."

Here we are, trying to predict the mkt demand and mkt supply for gloves 6 to 9 months down the road to derive at the prevailing mkt price of a glove counter.   Factors that could affect mkt demand for gloves: 1. Efficacy of vaccines vs virus mutations 2. World vaccination rates vs (uneven) distribution of vaccines worldwide 3. Level of increased hygiene awareness + living with the endemic  Factors that could affect mkt supply of gloves: 1. Number of existing suppliers worldwide 2. Number of new entrants worldwide  In the process, some variables could undergo changes and that can affect the whole analysis. This is especially so for the coronavirus' super-fast evolvements and mutations.  The recent spike in Covid-19 cases globally did not bring about a sharp rise in glove counters. Apparently, mkt operators are looking beyond the number of Covid-19 cases globally to form the basis of a glove counter's share price."

RUBEREX,John1234,1521 posts,2021-07-06 17:52:00,"Today, Comfort listed its free warrant at Bursa. But, it failed to provide a much-hoped-for catalyst to the glove counters(including Rubberex). Instead of pushing up Comfort's share price to match its exercise price, mkt operator chose to prop up its out-of-the-money warrant at a ridiculously high price: Comfort's closing price today:  RM 1.94 Comfort's warrant closing price: RM 0.305  Apparently, there appears a current mispricing of either the mother share or its warrant. How should mkt interpret this? Does this high warrant price suggest the mother share is underpriced currently and its share price will eventually exceed the combined exercised price within the next 5-years? Or the warrant price is artificially inflated by the mkt operator for a pump and dump?   Whatever it is, only time will tell. But one thing for sure, mkt can be more sophisticated than we can ever imagine possible!"

RUBEREX,John1234,1521 posts,2021-07-03 14:56:00,"STDN237649, your thinking is just being too ""normal"" and mkt can be more sophisticated than we can imagine.   Look at the share price movement of the glove counters in the last 2 months or so, they have been pressed down almost continuously to levels hardly imaginable(below fair values?). The fear of a falling knife has deterred many from active buying and bargain-hunting. As a result, I can see that a path of least resistance has since been created in the process. If they start pushing prices up with sufficiently large buy bids, some punters and technical traders out there will be attracted to jump in. Moreover, they may also create a short squeeze(short-covering) on the existing short bets, driving prices up too.   Mkt operators are no ordinary small players. They can play long or short based on their overall game plans and their own assessments of the ""real"" mkt conditions. Their only ""valid"" consideration is what they have got to gain by pushing up and if there is enough incentive for doing so.   Even if they were to do it, my guess is they would probably do it within their perceived ""safe"" zones, outside the ""selling"" range of most retail investors."

RUBEREX,skcm2017,206 posts,2021-07-05 12:33:00,"HLG : Rubber Gloves - ASPs Decline, But Shortage Remains   Going into 2H21, we expect nitrile glove ASPs to average at USD65-75 per thousand pieces. With vaccines appearing less effective against certain new variants and winter towards year end, we do not rule out the possibility of Covid-19 cases rising again, despite vaccination efforts in key markets. We lower Top Glove’s FY21/22 net profit forecasts by -3.3%/-2.6% and Kossan’s FY21 net profit forecasts -7.9% to account for lower sales volumes from smaller workforce capacity during FMCO. Maintain OVERWEIGHT. Top Pick: Top Glove (BUY, TP: RM6.72).  New variants and winter months a potential wildcard. While vaccination rates in key markets are progressing well (and resulting in lower daily Covid-19 cases) (Figure #2-3), we note that US and UK have begun relaxing lockdown rules, allowing large scale gatherings (sporting events, etc.). Despite this, there is growing evidence that vaccines may be less effective against new variants, particularly the delta variant (source). Note that while Covid-19 daily cases have declined in the US, the delta variant has roughly doubled every two weeks in the US (source). Coupled with the finding that Covid-19 (like seasonal flu) is more active during winter months (note that Covid-19 cases in US and UK peaked during winter), we reckon it is too early to rule out the possibility of Covid-19 cases rising in key markets again in the coming months, which would inevitably increase the demand for disposable gloves  -Santai reading-"

First liners Hartalega - premium and insti’s favourite. recent selloff make it almost back to pre covid level. Good price  Kossan - valuation is undemanding, almost no bad news or bad practice news. away from limelight. more stable one out of all  Top Glove - dividend champion. always aggresive in their business.   Supermax - most undervalued however had 0 support from mgmt. other counter still employ some buyback, they did not so their drop is more drastic than others.   Second Liners  Comfort - the most undervalued, owner is more modest, quite a good overall value  Careplus - recently acquired FDA approval to supply surgical glove through the subsidiary that they sold half to ansell. this shows ansell is helping them in distributionship.   Ruberex - undervalued. got expansion plan. low debt cash rich. However, i did not see their name in fda database means their focus is only Asia and Europe where they have distribution center in spain. are they able to sell only to these 2 region the 10b pieces? Owner recently sold down in very large quantity, company is cash rich but decided to do PP to raise fund for expansion diluting ownership but reward for shareholder? no dividend? Even careplus started giving dividend, rubberex? dun say because of expansion, if you did not PP then understandable. this u do PP to raise fund, but never give out any dividend.   So why did you choose Ruberex out of all options that you have. just want to see from your point of view. for me i am here to get more information, and would like to take position near its NA.

I previously owned Supermax for over 10 years and sold last year before it turned ex-bonus for around RM22.60 I think, and haven't looked at another glove counter until now."
RUBEREX,TheContrarian,6532 posts,2021-07-06 00:31:00,Spent half an hour doing a bit of research on Rubberex and noted that the single largest shareholder did indeed sell a chunk at RM1.40 level in April ; so who bought this chunk? Significant portion of revenue is derived in Malaysia which means no worries of US Customs blocking any shipment. Am I right about this? A built up of huge cash pile might mean a bumper dividend might come.

RUBEREX,Albukhary,2210 posts,2021-07-06 01:10:00,"As per my understanding, Ruberex Nitrile Glove got FDA 510k certification. That means its product are allow to export to US.  Why we buy Rubberex, below are the reason (my personal opinion) :-  1)  The share price is cheapest. We have a mindset that when glove trend is coming back, the lowest share price one will always give you the biggest return in percentage.  2)   Percentage increase of production capacity. Compare to other glove counter, their capacity only can increase 10%-20%, as their base is very big. But Ruberex is different, its base is small, from 1bil to 2.5bil is 150% increase, then from 2.5b to 5bil is another 100%, then from 5bil to 7.5bil is 50%.  3)  Because of its 150%, 100% 50% increase in capacity, we foresee its profit will be more stable compare to other glove counter. Example, if ASP drop 30%, Supermax profit may drop 50%. But for Ruberex, when ASP drop 30%, it can be cover by 100% increase of its capacity, so the impact of ASP drop is lower.  4)  We believe in Dato Eddie Ong. Compare to other glove boss, Dato Eddie look like more a risk taker. He is not traditional type of businessman, he is more like a capital market player who know how to press down the share price, how to goreng the share price, how to takeover other company. So we believe he will do something in near future."

Like when you buy rootbeer, usually anw rootbeer more expensive than tesco brand rootbeer. but you can see it both ways."
RUBEREX,neutralist,57 posts,2021-07-06 03:53:00,"@TheContrarian yes you have more experience than me. i believe so as well the price cannot fall forever. Yes latest quarter large chunck are sold to Malaysia. historically they sell most of their gloves in Europe. i think if they can continue selling more volume in europe then that would be good to sustain their expanded capacity in future. yes large chunk at 1.4. who else? if it is a strategic disposal, it would have been done off market via dbt. so if it is in open market, any tom d.ick and harry can be the receipient. if he believes in the company so much, he would not have sold any of his holding and keep through expansion unless ulterior motive is (just my opinion) to take the company private. then that is my reason to wait for price to be nearer to NA per share because he is capable and can press it to that level before acquiring.   @Albukhary thanks for sharing. ok i will recheck the fda database again. but when i search i could not find it. do you know under which name did they get the fda approval. your reasoning make sense. but last short push up, ruberex went up only 40%. but if you see others went up almost 60-100%. so reason no 1 does not seems applied here. 2 and 3 i totally agree. 4 is subjective. he is a capital market man, so what he does is usually of benefit to him not minority shareholders. hence only the one that can follow or knows he trends can benefit unless your entry is really low. last time he bought off directors exiting the company af rm1.80 per share which is 60 cents post BI. hence if it ever reach near that then i think is the safest entry."

RUBEREX,skcm2017,206 posts,2021-06-24 13:13:00,"KUALA LUMPUR (June 21): Rubberex Corp (M) Bhd has proposed a private placement of up to 83.23 million shares or 10% of its share capital to raise RM78.65 million.  From the proceeds to be raised – based on an indicative issue price of 94.5 sen per placement share – some RM69.13 million will be used to acquire 28 double-formers nitrile disposable glove production lines as part of its expansion in Perak, the company said. Another RM9 million will be used for working capital.  The Perak expansion will see an additional production capacity of up to 7.5 billion pieces of nitrile gloves per year. Total cost for the acquisition and installation of the production lines is at an estimated RM400 million, the glove maker said.  Post-placement, Rubberex largest shareholder Datuk Eddie One Choo Meng will see his shareholding trimmed to 33.86% from 37.24% currently."

If u think of it, yes actually if I were someone with alot of money, I would buy out the whole company.   The NAPS and Cash Balance itself is alot. Maybe more that the whole market cap itself. So if I buy whole rubberex at around 800M - 1B, following quarter is clean profit already, get to keep all of it.

RUBEREX,keown83,491 posts,2021-06-22 19:55:00,"@BrusaCasino averagely developing countries for sure will choose cheap chinese gloves while developed countries will choose a better brand..when i said a better brand, it will most probably from Top Glove, Harta, Kossan, Sri Trang (Thailand), Ansel (JV with Careplus), & Riverstone (Singapore)..the big question right is, will developed countries see Rubberex as a good quality brand or did they see Rubberex as just another cheap option glove supply on the same level of China product?  last time i see top known glove producer in the world from malaysia is Top Glove, Harta, Kossan & Supermax..rubberex is not in the list"

RUBEREX,ahchong01,69 posts,2021-06-23 00:47:00,"it is still a battle of perspective.   1. Glove making a lot of money now vs less money in future  Yes, now is abnormal profit, but increase in demand means opportunity to expand and still able to sell all your capacity. Even with drop in ASP, the quantum of volume and lower cost can help in at least make the company maintain about 50-70% of the eps. The key here is not ASP dropping, but what will be the normalize ASP after pandemic. Some say USD 28, some say USD 40, some say USD 45. Is up to your research. if everyone knows, all will be billionaire already. As an investor, this is where you need to do your research well and use your deduction power. Then you would be able to know what entry is consider undervalue.   2.  China expand like crazy and will overtake Malaysia  Yes they expand quite quickly or do they. Can name me 10 companies with volume of their new capacity and which market they supply to? I think there is a reason we went through multiple pandemics and Malaysia is still the world leader in glove. Don’t look down on 20-30 years of experience and RND spent by Malaysian glove company. If you think China will be the world leader, then you are free not to invest here. But i stick to believing that Malaysia will keep being the leader in gloves worldwide and China cannot dethrone Malaysia. And all these China going big even by analyst, is without backings or evidence. It is just a sentence of ‘our analyst is in view of’. That is all.   3. Cannot sell new capacity  Current order is fully taken up until end of the year. Started taking 2022 order. Expansion is imminent. And having been in the industry for more than 10-15 years, will definitely give you better advantage. Buy iphone or buy iphone clone from dunno where with same ui and function better? lol  4. Analyst keeps downgrading. They must have known something we don’t knw  To me analyst has their own KPI to achieve and like how you are working in your company, to meet your KPi, you will do whatever it takes. Not to say all is like that, but if analyst is ever correct, why did when last few quarters glove companies has outperform their expectation and they keep downgrading the price but increasing their forecast numbers. The moment some slightly underperform, you lower your forecast and the forecast is probably higher than your initial forecast with a lower TP than your initial TP last time. It is like everytime you working as sales person, exceed sales target, give higher target but cut your commission. Once you cannot achieve your higher or increased sales target, say you are a failure and cut your comission and your bonus also now. You cannot win liao like that. Lol.   Just my 2cents. Do your own research. No need to badmouth investor who wish to buy in nor shall we condemn shall you want to cut win or cut lose."

RUBEREX,BrusaCasino,249 posts,2021-06-22 10:25:00,"To be honest. PP is a double edge sword. Can be good can be bad. If the PP is bought by good fund, e.g. EPF, Kumpulan Wang. Then I will support.   I seen recently Careplus now Rubberex both 10% PP. It could be a coincidence. Either that or its really a EPF wanting to get into lower cap glove stock. Because recently EPF on a buying frenzy, buying topglove and kossan like there is no tomorrow."
RUBEREX,BrusaCasino,249 posts,2021-06-22 10:27:00,"That is my speculation. What is not speculation is Comfort gloves having the Lowest PE, giving dividend and free warrents. Their cash balance also increase alot, so has their net assets"

Mkt is very dynamic and evolving. With Fed Reserve starting to forecast 2 rate hikes in 2023, funds have started to reposition their portfolios to prepare for a rising US $ and a less dovish trading environment. With this new development, we could expect ringgit to weaken against the US $ near term and this is likely to benefit our export sector in general(which also includes the cash-rich glove sector).   A share price is usually dependent upon a number of counteracting factors at play. It is interesting to see how things work out in such a dynamic trading environment, much like how virus variants could mutate.   It is always prudent to do our own homework before investing!"

Rubberex lags slightly behind Comfort currently.   Without doing homework, we cannot make a meaningful comparison."

According to her, the improving Covid-19 situations in the US and EU resulted in much lesser urgency for distributors to immediately replenish inventories back to usual levels of two to three months.  “The buyers are adopting a more careful stance currently to avoid locking in purchases at high prices.  “We expect ASPs of gloves to start trending lower in the second half, supported by the improved Covid-19 situation as well as lower raw material prices as tight supply of nitrile butadiene latex continues to ease and [with a] better yield for latex concentrate after the end of the wintering season in May,” she said.  She also noted that glove makers’ commitment to stepping up on their social compliance practices will also translate into higher costs going forward, and she reckoned that it would take time for glove makers to fully pass on the cost increase to buyers, so it should result in margin compression in the near term.  Chua downgraded her rating of Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd to ""neutral"", with a lower target price (TP) of RM3.65.  “We cut our FY21 to FY23 earnings forecasts for Kossan by 37% to 51% to account for the expected decline in ASPs,” she said.  She also maintained her ""neutral"" call on Top Glove Corp Bhd but lowered her TP to RM4.40."
RUBEREX,ahchong01,69 posts,2021-06-21 13:23:00,"so. analyst is there to give opinion. previously 3 consecutive quarter gloves company has outperformed their expectation. what did they do? increase forecast, cut target price. then when met expectation after 3 times being wrong what did they do? cut target price and maintain forecast. when slightly below their expectation what did they do? cut target price and reduce their forecast. what can glove need to do to make analyst increase their target price? nothing. lol. their report is to get some insights but if you can analyse your own is better. lol."

Because of this they had to cancel their plans due to market know what they want to do, and they should keep maintain their image. And because these plans are not conducive to our investors.  It’s ridiculous, those of them who are always dissenting voices do not understand. That’s why I said that there is too much difference with them. Fortunately, there are still wise people.

PRLEXUS,karadis,202 posts,2021-07-24 11:12:00,"@Wong Yi Ming gave a very important thought to everyone. ""It is normal for the company incurred loss in this economy climate because of pandamic. Prolexus cash in hand RM130m compare borrowing RM 90 million, still consider net cash company.""  If you think purely, it seems that Prolexus is still healthy, and the net cash company will not be a problem.  But if you think deeply:  1. How much revenue does Prolexus need in each quarter to balance the profit and loss? Because his revenue has fallen to the lowest point since 2009. There has been a quarterly loss.  2. What is the total loan repayment and cost in each quarter?  3. How long will this epidemic last? The global epidemic has increased rapidly with Delta virus cases, when will it end? ""It is normal for the company incurred loss in this economy climate because of pandamic."" Then if there is a loss every quarter under the circumstances, and there is still RM 90 million in debt, how long can Prolexus support it? Will the stock price fall to less than 0.1 like AAX once did?  Everyone might as well think about it.  ""Don't fall in love with a stock.""  ""Cash is King, especially at this moment"""

It is also proven that 3Q Prolexus will incurred loss in 3Q. 4Q will be a huge jump in turnover and profit. Therefore, I am also have doubt for some person intend to mislead other interested investor."

If compare with the past 2 year, this year Q3 loss is the lowest. However, the management need to improve the revenue as Q3 revenue is the lowest so far. This is without doubt that it might be caused by FMCO with lower production and so do with the retailer / customers unable to place any orders during FMCO."

Don't worry, it is absolutely safe!!!  No more orders for masks? Don’t worry, Prolexus masks don't need export orders, they can exclusively sold in Malaysia. Everyone buys one, and there are 30 million people in the country. Each mask earns RM1, which is MYR 30 million every month. Just one quarter there is a turnover of MYR 90 million!!! It will definitely break a turnover of MYR100 million in the next quarter!!!  At that time, the stock price will definitely break through RM5, which is 10 times the current price. Bros, hold it!!

I have given enough kindly reminders and tried my best to help everyone study the actual situation of Prolexus by numbers and logic, but if you are willing to be controlled by greed, insist on believing @alvin1188, insist on falling in love with stocks, so you can't blame others, you just can blame yourself only.  Data has never deceived people. The data has warned that everyone needs to pay attention. It warned that there is a problem with Prolexus, but you have chosen to be blinded by greed, insisting that you are the righteous party, insisting that QR is definitely good, persist in emotional and only believe in what you believe.  Before the QR was released, some people called me a liar and condemned me that Prolexus's QR must be very good. They also wrote to Prolexus management to verify. I just said it was a joke.  Now that QR is released, it's bad! No, it's super bad. As a result, the same group of people still came out and barked. Sad people..."

The most likely target for offline transactions should be Lau Mong Ying, the boss of Prolexus.  After reading such an announcement, what we need to think about as investors is why the director of Prolexus - Chin Chew Mun, wants to sell his stock in full? If QR is good, then why would he choose to clear all the stock in his hand?  In addition, do you know the professional background of the director of Prolexus - Chin Chew Mun? He is a Chartered Accountants!!!  This is a very important information.  http://www.klsescreener.com/v2/announcements/view/209820  Don't blind your eyes because of emotions.

PRLEXUS,Newbieinshare,1813 posts,2021-07-07 18:29:00,"bro Karadis. your comment is totally misleading many people. Dealing during close period doesnt mean offline transaction. Usually offline transaction we call it DBT or direct business transaction in which the shares are transacted off market. Meanwhile share dealing during closed period means: The close period (or closed period) is the time between the completion of a listed company's financial results and the announcing of these results to the public. Because prlexus are due for QR announcement this month, so all big shareholders or company directors who intend to buy or sell their shares all need to announce before hand"

PRLEXUS,karadis,202 posts,2021-07-07 18:34:00,"Chin Chew Mun --- Chartered Accountants + Core Member of the Prolexus's Board of Directors, these two key identities represent that:  1. He knows better than anyone in the market whether Prolexus's physique is healthy or not?  Is it already in the critically ill?  2. His professional ability is sufficient to judge whether a company is necessary continue to hold.  Therefore, the message of Prolexus director-Chin Chew Mun choosing to sell his full stock in is an important directional indicator.  Then why would he choose to trade offline?   Under normal circumstances, he will communicate privately and adopt offline transactions instead of selling in the open market if he chooses to clear full stocks in his hand. Unless their relationship is extremely bad, This It is the basic processing method.  Two important members of the Prolexus board of directors have chosen to clear their stocks and leave within half a year, this is an intriguing matter.

PRLEXUS,Newbieinshare,1813 posts,2021-07-07 18:45:00,means there is high chance the QR will be announced on 23JULY2021
PRLEXUS,Newbieinshare,1813 posts,2021-07-07 19:50:00,"@Karidis..... now i just read your post and i think u r really a joker. warrant B exercise value is 0.56 and the exercise ratio is 1:1. The 0.56 is the conversion price and not the company issue price! Dont misleading anyone with ur half bucket water knowledge. Newbie like me may get misled and die! It mean in order to convert 1 warrant B to 1 mother share, you need to pay rm0.56 + your 1 warrant B price. let say if u got ur warrant B at 0 cost , you only need to pay 0.56 to convert it to mother share (excluding some administrative expenses)  and that 0.56 is to pay to the company (so company can indirectly get more funding from the warrant conversion) Company actually no need to pay any money to issue a company warrant (set aside those admin fee to pay to the investment company) ================================================================= @top_aspen @Newbieinshare @Jason  Do you know why Warrants B has not been listed yet?  There are actually conspiracies and reasons. That's why I replied @Jason said ""maybe the Warrants B will list out after the bad result QR.""  Think about it, everyone: 1. Is Warrants B issue free for everyone?  2. After you get Warrants B, will you consider selling it? Directly in exchange for cash?  3. If (1) & (2) your answers are both Yes. Then think about it, when you sell Warrants B, who is responsible for paying? Of course it is the person who issued Warrants B. That is Prolexus.  4. According to the announment before, the Warrant exercise price is 0.56. It means that they will buy it back at a price of 0.56 (if you sell it at the moment).  5. Assuming that the stock price continues to decline (it has fallen by 31.88%), how much should the price of Warrants B shoule be fall now?  6. Assuming that QR comes out very unsatisfactorily and the stock price continues to fall, Warrants B is released at that time. The price of Warrants B may drop directly to 0.3. At that time, Prolexus only needs to use 0.30 to buy back Warrants (if you sell at the moment). They can save 46.43% immediately. Are they very smart?  Smart but treacherous enough!  Everyone understands that how Prolexus and his team are playing the dirty games now!"
PRLEXUS,FactCheck,16 posts,2021-07-07 19:56:00,@karadis I'm puzzled as to how you arrived at your conclusion that Chew Mun was selling all his shares. Or that he is selling via an offline transaction.  Is this stated anywhere?

PRLEXUS,YC88,41 posts,2021-07-07 20:23:00,Hahahahaha @karadis can't even understand a simple announcement and keep saying one of the director wants to sell off all his shares. I think we can conclude that all his previous analyses are bs.

PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-04 12:48:00,"I made a wrong decision. I invested most of my pension in Prolexus. The following trend has a huge impact on me. That why I seriously re-read everyone's comments and analysis in the forum during the past six months yesterday, especially karadis and alvin1188 comments.  The two of them vie with each other like a spear and a shield, and they are completely opposed to each other. This is a rare situation in other forums.  I believe anyone who saw Karadis's sharing about four months ago would hate him. What kind of shit analysis sharing, his analysis basically gave a message: ""Prolexus's fundamentals have been corrupted, and every situation will deteriorate. The current results are just an illusion.""  But now looking back after the fact, according to the performance of the stock price, Warrant A fell to 0.005. Analysis and correlation of events such as share buyback, BI, WI, etc., turned out that his analysis was reasonable. Indeed, the entire development seemed to be as predicted by Karadis. On the other hand, alvin1188 disappeared for no reason. He vowed to say that everything is good before. In that's the situation now, he should jump out and say something, right?"
PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-04 12:52:00,"alvin1188 tells us that Karadis is a liar, but after re-study all comments found that alvin1188 sharing is basically not like Karadis's analysis using data and logic. He is more like a content person who has internal information, because he always seems to know the development trend of Prolexus for the first time.  He was so active in promote Prolexus, and beat each other so fiercely with Karadis. I have some doubts whether he is a top management or insider of Prolexus now?"
PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-04 12:59:00,"I also found that POONJ is another old stockholder who was not optimistic about Prolexus at the beginning. I saw that POONJ has 943 total comments. He started comments in 2013 and involved many companies.  Another interesting thing is that I saw the interaction between Sujibaby and Karadis in March. Based on their interaction, I found that Sujibaby seemed to know the inside information of Prolexus from the beginning, and intentionally or unintentionally guided Karadis to dig deeper.  Karadis's position and analysis concept are already very clear, just see if the follow-up situation develops as he expected. I have doubts about the identity of @alvin1188 and @sujibaby, that why I hope they can come out and share the opinions and analysis, could you please come out and talk about it?"

PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-05 11:07:00,"The parent stock was weak, falling more than 5%, not optimistic. I sold half of the free Wa, take some in hands to be safer."
PRLEXUS,FactCheck,16 posts,2021-07-05 11:09:00,"@jojo69 : I'll drop a note because you seem quite stressed. In the long term, the fundamentals are in your favor. It's a company that has survived the pandemic by innovating into face masks, and has a good cash position. If you can leave your investment for a period of 12-24 months , I think you can relax a little.  Karadis in my opinion hasn't really offered good analysis and just likes to be heard. More emotions than facts (e.g. extrapolating multiple conclusions from just quarterly trends, which is irresponsible analysis)  Sujibaby at least did a decent analysis at the sub-segment level. I had thought many people missed the LAD element in last quarter's results.  That said, no-one can tell you with certainty whether the next QR is good or bad. (i.e. I'm not sure if either Karadis or Sujibaby would be willing to bet their life savings that it is negative , likewise no-one can guarantee you that it will be a good QR)  I say this because. Prolexus is a company that has been hit (like any other apparel company) , with declining sales due to COVID, and did a good move by pivoting into masks (imagine if they didn't?). As the apparel industry recovers, Prolexus's core business will recover as well. When and how much is the question, but clearly, now is a low point in the business and only two outcomes are possible - recovery , or bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is unlikely due to its cash position and alternative revenue from masks in the interim. If it's any comfort, Nike has reported a strong fourth quarter , +96% in revenues and +73% in sales, so there are signs of industry recovery.  My personal view is that you should look closely at the QR , but consider it one of many that you will have to follow with an exit horizon of 12-24 months. In that sense, there is low risk to your capital. Just a lot of opportunity loss if you were looking to punt the money somewhere else."
PRLEXUS,charlie chia,1620 posts,2021-07-05 11:43:00,Sujibaby Can share your blog
PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-05 11:52:00,"Thank you very much to all the friends who are caring and reply.  In particular, I would like to thank @YC88, because he said a very important piece of information in his reply, which I made a mistake and ignored.  ""Anyone can just create an account to create rumours and false information here just for their own agenda. So just do your own homework and analysis. Don’t believe too much on what others say here.""  What he said makes a lot of sense.  I shouldn't just listen to the good news that I like and ignore the development of trends. In the past few days, I have carefully reviewed myself, and I really shouldn't be against the trend. It is clear that the trend is declining, but the additional capital investment in order to spread the cost has greatly increased my loss.  Although Karadis is always against the tune, competing with alvin1188. But apart from some emotional language, I seriously think about his opinion and some logic predict, combined with Prolexus' operations and market reactions. I have not rejected his views as I did at the beginning.  Thanks again @FactCheck your thoughtful response and kind suggestions. I will refer to your opinion. But frankly speaking, I am more inclined to @YC88's suggestion, don't trust the sharing in the forum, especially if it is purposeful and offensive.  Your ID hasn’t been registered for long, and the main comments are focused on promoting Prolexus. So your identity is also questionable.  You said: Nike has reported a strong fourth quarter, +96% in revenues and +73% in sales, so there are signs of industry recovery.  Although NIKE's performance has grown, it does not mean that orders will be given to Prolexus. In particular, our great government is implementing endless FMCO, and garment factories' orders for garments are not within the scope of permitted production. I believe that the next performance is unlikely to be too good.  After careful consideration and discussion with professional old friends, although I really hope that the stock price will rise, but I decided not to deceive myself. The most important thing is to reduce losses now.  For 12-24 months, the risk is too high. No one knows how long this epidemic will last, and no one knows what will happen in the future. If Prolexus really does not have an order for masks, and NIKE has not placed an order for it, and the endless MCO does not allow production, how long can Prolexus' cash support? These are unknowns.  I believe that the delayed QR will bring a clear answer, and I will reduce my losses as much as possible according to the trend.  Anyway, thank you for sharing."

PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-05 14:41:00,"@FactCheck, By the way, you mentioned that Prolexus quickly launched the innovative Fabric Mask in the early stages of the epidemic. I approve of its performance in this regard. It is really not easy for them to change quickly, and the people who dominate this goal are indeed talent and very courageous. I have also been a management team and know that it is extremely challenging to promote a change, especially something completely unfamiliar, and I will definitely encounter many difficulties and obstacles. Prolexus boss definitely very courageous, dare to innovate and change, otherwise his team will be difficult to succeed.  But I noticed that Prolexus' mask products have not been improved or innovated for half a year.  They once advertised the launch of Personal Protective Apparel, strongly believe that these kind of products should be very marketable, especially the brand should like it very much, which is a very good selling point. But I haven't seen the release of related products until now. I was wondering why the initial change was so rapid and successful (this is also the main reason why I invested in Prolexus), why it seems that it have stand still in the past six months? Could it be that there was a problem with the main change team at the time? Success lies in the team, and failure also lies in the team. Especially the leading soul figure."

PRLEXUS,karadis,202 posts,2021-07-05 19:25:00,"Mother will fly to 0.80? That is impossible, unless the boss of Prolexus wants to be Santa Claus and give money to everyone, intending to use the company's internal funds continue to buy tickets. But then the QR that he delayed until the last minute will really drag it down. Perhaps such an irrational operation will be the last straw to crush the company.  Conscience suggests that unless you can print banknotes like the United States, you really have to think carefully about this kind of operation.  Of course, if you want to be Santa Claus and give money to everyone, we are also very happy. Let us celebrate the early Christmas together."
PRLEXUS,karadis,202 posts,2021-07-05 19:37:00,"If your coming QR performance is good, you don't need to push your share price more higher by yourself, because the relevant agencies will naturally come in and help you to raise the price when receiving your good news. You just need to take the opportunity to exert your money power, and pushed up the stock price accordingly at this time. This way you can achieve maximum capital efficiency at the lowest cost.  If your coming QR performance is not good, you want to stop the decline at this time. Frankly speaking, it is not ideal, because the previous market has been broken by your operator.   You will waste your money bullets. Good words to persuade, if you are willing to believe it, please refer to it, if not, please feel free."

(share buy back)  i have learned from sujibaby that we also need to keep monitoring closely the company performance by segment,    i was lost 10% on powerroot when they come out with a very good QR after MCO 1.0 and the management telling all the shareholder that the company are benefited from pandemic by selling Instant Coffee to oversea and they are very optimistic on the incoming quarter.  end up those optimistic earnings is only sustain temporary for 1 QR, then the profitability and share price keep dropping like falling knife. even the core business is also shrinking , fortunately i do strictly executed my trading plan to cut loss in 10% and never average down or look back, (the share price is dropped from RM2.4 to RM1.3 afterward) i noticed this company got little bit common in power root case(just little bit only). the sudden good QR attract many investors but the sudden profit is no sustainable."

As I said, I am still very positive on the prospect of Prlexus.  If you compare me against that liar/cheap Karadis, I don't say I heard rumours...  he even said it is rumoured that I am hired by Prlexus... my reaction was... wtx... hahaha....  he also said.. it is rumoured that Prlexus lost Nike & ASICs... again rumour.. But i wrote an email to Prlexus management to clarify... they confirmed that both are still their customers... i also shared that email here with everyone..  Just ask yourself a few questions: 1) Why Karadis spent so much time here if he is not interested in Prlexus share? It is obvious that he wanted to instil rumour and negative sentiments here so everyone sells off their shares cheap. then he can collect it cheap. simple logic, right? Or do you think he is a kind SAINT, he spent his time here earning nothing, but to save the world? hahahaha  2) I gave facts, he gave nonsense (rumours, bla bla bla).. and his so-called analysis on the forecast QR (which he shared the links) are all out if you check against the actual QR. ppl with no creditability like this, you wanna sell off your shares cheap to him  last but not least, I won't come here every day to read and comment like Karadis who definitely has his bad motive so he can spend time here to cheat ppl to sell off.

There are actually conspiracies and reasons. That's why I replied @Jason said ""maybe the Warrants B will list out after the bad result QR.""  Think about it, everyone: 1. Is Warrants B issue free for everyone?  2. After you get Warrants B, will you consider selling it? Directly in exchange for cash?  3. If (1) & (2) your answers are both Yes. Then think about it, when you sell Warrants B, who is responsible for paying? Of course it is the person who issued Warrants B. That is Prolexus.  4. According to the announment before, the Warrant exercise price is 0.56. It means that they will buy it back at a price of 0.56 (if you sell it at the moment).  5. Assuming that the stock price continues to decline (it has fallen by 31.88%), how much should the price of Warrants B shoule be fall now?  6. Assuming that QR comes out very unsatisfactorily and the stock price continues to fall, Warrants B is released at that time. The price of Warrants B may drop directly to 0.3. At that time, Prolexus only needs to use 0.30 to buy back Warrants (if you sell at the moment). They can save 46.43% immediately. Are they very smart?  Smart but treacherous enough!

You may refer to my post to know more;  https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/sujibaby_yongtai/2021-06-29-story-h1...  Not in a position to advise for cut lost. Trade with caution. Protect your capital first and know your holding strength. If my calculation is right and the QR is bad, many holders will sell.  Technical wise, it looks terrible for the price to rebound any soon."
PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-02 13:46:00,"@sujibaby, Bad QR? How bad can it be? Last time I watched @alvin1188 and he shared that the next quarterly report will be very good. He said that the masks are sold in several countries and the sales are good. He even email to Prolexus, and Prolexus replied that the big customers like NIKE & Asics are still there, everything seems nice and excellent. Why suddenly it seems that the sky has changed, it is not the same thing at all, and it loses? ?"
PRLEXUS,jojo69,39 posts,2021-07-02 13:56:00,I chose to believe @alvin1188 before. I took advantage of the BI activity and bought some share. They were all good before the release of BI. Why did they drop so much after the BI release? Are they really deliberately deceiving us? Damm...
PRLEXUS,maxhoi,21 posts,2021-07-02 14:07:00,"@sujibaby, I hope you are wrong but looks like you are most likely right."
PRLEXUS,sujibaby,147 posts,2021-07-02 14:11:00,"@jojo69: The profit margin for apparel is relatively low. Based on my study, taking the current range of USD-MYR conversion rate, the QR tends to go negative every time the revenue drops below RM 60 million. Last quarter and the quarter before fabric mask inclusion seems to be OK due to: 1) higher profit margin of the fabric mask 2) textile factory loss margin reduced due to inter-segment sales (due to fabric mask)  @alvin1188 checked with the management to know whether NIKE & Asics were still there but, he did not ask whether the orders have reduced or not. Because, numbers do not lie and the numbers tell us that the revenue has been decreasing.  Cant comment on the BI strategy but, from my observation, if the company is trying to boost the price through BI, it is a bad move indeed.  Trade with risk control. If you are a technical trader, you know that the chart looks terrible.  Trade safe."
PRLEXUS,sujibaby,147 posts,2021-07-02 14:16:00,"@maxhoi: I understand the emotion involved as a trader. But, sometimes fundamental analysis is important for us to know when to hold or cut. I hope i am wrong too because I know the pain of losing hard earned money in the market, but, the delay of QR makes me to think otherwise. The technical looks like its about to plunge below 0.48 by closing. I wish everyone the best decisions. Trade safe guys, be strong."

PRLEXUS,karadis,202 posts,2021-07-02 14:29:00,"When everyone dislikes me, or even opposes and insults me, I still insist on in-depth analysis, hoping to help everyone see all the facts through a different angled analysis. And performance and stock price are the best proof.  If QR is not released for one day, we are not sure how bad QR will be! It may be just the balance of the profit and loss, it may lose a little bit, or the loss may be huge.  But what is certain is that their strategy is problematic. I think their management needs to review. Either this is a decision error of MD, or a proposal error of the CEO or CFO.  How to say? Share Buy Back 10% is a strategy to reduce the number of shares outstanding in the market. The Bonus Issue is a strategy to increase the number of shares outstanding in the market. These two strategies are contradictory, completely opposite strategies. Have you ever seen that listed company operate like that at the same time?  And the original plan was to share Buy Back first, then BI. Now that BI is implemented, Share Buy Back is gone. Under normal circumstances, it is impossible to implement Share Buy Back again, because if there is a conflict of interest in Share Buy Back after BI, Bursa needs to investigate.  According to technical analysis, everything is not optimistic.  https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/karadis/550264.jsp  Be careful when you take the average down approach. This always is the main cause of major losses. Protecting our capital is the first creed in the stock market. We should trade with the risk control."

I will consider entering the market when it is really adjusted to a reasonable price only.    It depends on how this quarter's financial report is? Need to further analyze their financial report and see what plans they have next.  I found the problem based on the analysis of two quarters ago.

There are actually conspiracies and reasons. That's why I replied @Jason said ""maybe the Warrants B will list out after the bad result QR.""  Think about it, everyone: 1. Is Warrants B issue free for everyone?  2. After you get Warrants B, will you consider selling it? Directly in exchange for cash?  3. If (1) & (2) your answers are both Yes. Then think about it, when you sell Warrants B, who is responsible for paying? Of course it is the person who issued Warrants B. That is Prolexus.  4. According to the announment before, the Warrant exercise price is 0.56. It means that they will buy it back at a price of 0.56 (if you sell it at the moment).  5. Assuming that the stock price continues to decline (it has fallen by 31.88%), how much should the price of Warrants B shoule be fall now?  6. Assuming that QR comes out very unsatisfactorily and the stock price continues to fall, Warrants B is released at that time. The price of Warrants B may drop directly to 0.3. At that time, Prolexus only needs to use 0.30 to buy back Warrants (if you sell at the moment). They can save 46.43% immediately. Are they very smart?  Smart but treacherous enough!

So dont buy stock after BI, let it settle first. BI and warrant basically will benefit the directors, major shareholders as they have a lot of shares. Bonus issue terms used ia actually misleading, the price will be adjusted accordingly after ex date, so your porftolio value will be the same. As i said those benefited is the long term holders as the price will be goreng up until ex date. If you happened to buy the stocks just before the ex date i.e price already goreng up, then good luck to you. Of course if you re going long term and the counter is fundamentally good, then probability is the price will rise."

At the same time, @alvin1188 is so uneducated, he always has to speak bad words, and he cannot be analyzed on the basis of facts, so he must be given proper education.  @xcu843, you are right. This is indeed a company that is about to decay, just because QR 2020-07 saved them in that quarter. But his internal has actually rotted. We can analyze it through successive earnings reports.

It is expected that @alvin1188 will be very firm and reasonable to share with us that the upcoming quarterly financial report will be better than the previous quarter.

PRLEXUS,karadis,202 posts,2021-06-28 12:22:00,"According to technical analysis, we see that the daily trend, the weekly trend, and even the monthly trend are in a downward state. This has given us the message that it is not the suitable time to enter the market.  If once the coming quarterly earnings report is really unsatisfactory, the stock price will fall sharply like a snowball.  We can do a calculation. The current stock price is 0.57. If you buy at this position, and if the stock price drops to 0.40 (down 30%). Want to return to 0.57, you need to rise 43%.  If it falls to 0.35 (down 39%), and wants to return to 0.57, it needs to rise by 63%.  If it falls to 0.30 (down 47%), and wants to return to 0.57, it needs to rise by 90%.  So why we want to let us stay in the risk position? This is why I asking people wait until the quarterly earnings report come out, then you can make a decision with clearly view."

One is the strategy when know the future performance is good; the other is the strategy when know the performance is not good.  In a disguised form, the company's money is transferred into the amount of its their own shares.  Will the Share Buy Back program be executed in the next? Repurchase 10% of the shares from the market, the overall number of shares will decrease, then the percentage of shares held by these major shareholders will increase in disguise, thus enriching their pockets? If so, really Full of fun!"

PRLEXUS,drkewsc,8 posts,2021-06-24 13:42:00,Haven’t experience such a big drop after BI ? Anyone know why for this counter ?
PRLEXUS,amet2017,2799 posts,2021-06-24 14:02:00,"So many cases already after BI drop. This is because once BI announced, they will goreng the price up. So dont buy stock after BI, let it settle first. BI and warrant basically will benefit the directors, major shareholders as they have a lot of shares. Bonus issue terms used ia actually misleading, the price will be adjusted accordingly after ex date, so your porftolio value will be the same. As i said those benefited is the long term holders as the price will be goreng up until ex date. If you happened to buy the stocks just before the ex date i.e price already goreng up, then good luck to you. Of course if you re going long term and the counter is fundamentally good, then probability is the price will rise."
PRLEXUS,learnbyheart,403 posts,2021-06-24 14:09:00,agree with amet..some trader just push up the price because of the news. no harm to long term as the company is fundamentally strong with pile of cash reserved
